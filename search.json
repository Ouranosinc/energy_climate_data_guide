CaSR v3.1 is produced by dynamically downscaling ECMWF’s ERA5 global reanalysis using operational models and configurations of ECCC’s operational weather and environmental prediction system to provide historical, high-resolution climate and weather data over North America, with a focus on Canada. Surface observations of tempererature, humidity, snow depth and precipitation are integrated through the the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) coupled with the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). CaSR is a consistent and seamless dataset providing the main meteorological variables coherent with in situ surface observations1. Note that the CaSR dataset was previously known as RDRS (Regional Deterministic Reforecast System).\n\n\n\nCaSR simulation domain with station locations2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent version: v3.1\nTemporal coverage: 1970–2024\nTemporal resolution: Hourly and daily outputs\n\nSpatial coverage: Canada and U.S.\nSpatial resolution: ~10 km grid spacing (0.09˚)\nData type: A dynamical downscaling of ERA5 (ERA-Interim for version 2.1) over North and Central America domain using ECCC’s Global Deterministic Reforecast System (GDRS), the global surface model (GEM-Surf) the Regional Deterministic Reforecast System (RDRS), coupled with the CaLDAS surface assimilation system.3\nWeb references:  ECCC Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) Web Site,  Northern Climate Data Report and Inventory (NCDRI) Web Site\nReference publications: See references below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHigh resolution\n~10 km grid spacing provides detailed spatial variability, better than global reanalyses.\n\n\nHourly data availability\nUseful for high-frequency climate and weather analysis.\n\n\nAssimilation of observed precipition\nUnlike other reanalysis products observed precipitation is assimilated.\n\n\nDetailed precipitation\nPrecipitation types are distiguished, including freezing rain.Two versions of precipitation are provided: one purely modeled and the reanalysis version that assimilates measured precipitation data are provided.\n\n\nPrecipitation confidence index\nA confidence index for precipitation informs on the weight of observations in the analysis.\n\n\nConsistent Historical Record\nSpans over four decades, allowing for trend analysis and climate studies.ToDo: This was communicated to not hold for CaSR v2.1; Is this still true for CaSR v3.1?\n\n\nActive Development\nNew versions and longer temporal record are in preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nKnown biases\nCaSR is generally too wet and has an overall cold bias.\n\n\nUncommon Georeference\nThe data are made available on a rotated grid which may be difficult to handle. The PAVICS platform hosts a tutorial dedicated to the conversion of rotated grids.\n\n\nLimited Suitability for Trend Analysis\nFor the current version, gaps in observation data and model errors may skew trends found in the dataset.ToDo: This was communicated for CaSR v2.1 but should be corrected in CaSR v3.1..\n\n\nLimited to the Surface or Near-Surface\nCaSR provides no data above 40m above surface.\n\n\nComputationally Intensive\nRelatively high-resolution data requires significant storage and processing power for analysis over larger areas.

CaSR has one of the highest spatial resolutions of gridded observational datasets over Canada and North America and it distinguishes itself from other reanalysis products through the assimilation of precipitation observations through the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). It is therefore coherent with in situ observations of precipitation, absolute and dew point temperature and snow depth. The model used in the production includes a representation of lakes, which influence local climate. This feature is visible particularly in the shoulder season temperature fields and influences the thermal surface properties. The CaPA system used to produce the gridded precipitation fields includes strict quality control procedures to avoid the assimilation of biased observations. This includes using wind speed to determine validity of solid precipitation measurements depending on the gauge type and weather station characteristics. Due to the complexity of the prodedure and difficulties with quality control radar data are currently not assimilated. Overall, CaSR was conceptualized for hydrological applications, where high-resolution precipitation and land-surface variables are critical.1\nTemperature biases in CaSR exhibit an annual cycle with larger errors in winter and spring and smaller errors in summer and autumn. When compared to the NRCanMET gridded observations, CaSR shows slightly warmer mean minimum temperatures and slightly colder mean maximum temperatures. As a result, the daily temperature range in CaSR is narrower than in NRCanMET. Air temperature biases are clearly correlated to elevation differences between nearby stations and the corresponding grid elevation. With improvement in the latest version of CaSR spring temperatures are higher and less biased in version 3.1 than in version 2.1. Pixels near water or mixed water/land pixels tend to exhibit a stronger cold bias. Overall, the magnitude of the biases varies by temperature variable and region, emphasizing the need for validation of the dataset at a particular location.\nPrecipitation in CaSR is generally positively biased, and this bias tends to increase with distance from the assimilated in-situ stations. The dataset is wetter than ERA5-Land, which itself is part of a broader tendency of reanalyses to be too wet. Mountain precipitation is better resolved in CaSR than in ERA5-Land or NRCanMET, owing to its higher spatial resolution. Due to the offline precipitation analysis inconsistencies can arise with other modeled fields such as radiation and humidity.\nA study over British Columbia watersheds, confirms CaSR’S persistent cold bias alongside a wet bias. CaSR version 2.1 also shows drying trends in BC watersheds. The dataset proves skillful in capturing spatial mountain patterns and temporal trends.4\nVersion 3.1 of CaSR represents a major improvement over version 2.1. It shows better agreement with surface observations across all variables, seasons, and domains. Precipitation performance is similar or slightly improved, and the version includes the additional benefit of a new precipitation partitioning into rainfall and snowfall. Version 3.1 also assimilates up to 1,000 more observations per analysis, particularly improving winter performance in Canada.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinks to Electricity Sector Activities\n\n\n\nFor details click on variable group to uncollapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature [˚C]\nDew point temperature [˚C]\n\nTemperature variables are provided at 1h & 3h frequency and at levels 1.5 m, ~20m, and ~40m.

    "text": "Click to toggle section collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) dataset provides high-resolution, gridded climate data with seamless coverage across North America. CaSR has one of the highest spatial resolutions of gridded observational datasets over Canada and North America and it distinguishes itself from other reanalysis products through the assimilation of precipitation observations through the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). It is therefore coherent with in situ observations of precipitation, absolute and dew point temperature and snow depth. The model used in the production includes a representation of lakes, which influence local climate. This feature is visible particularly in the shoulder season temperature fields and influences the thermal surface properties. The CaPA system used to produce the gridded precipitation fields includes strict quality control procedures to avoid the assimilation of biased observations. This includes using wind speed to determine validity of solid precipitation measurements depending on the gauge type and weather station characteristics. Due to the complexity of the prodedure and difficulties with quality control radar data are currently not assimilated. Overall, CaSR was conceptualized for hydrological applications, where high-resolution precipitation and land-surface variables are critical.1\nTemperature biases in CaSR exhibit an annual cycle with larger errors in winter and spring and smaller errors in summer and autumn. When compared to the NRCanMET gridded observations, CaSR shows slightly warmer mean minimum temperatures and slightly colder mean maximum temperatures. As a result, the daily temperature range in CaSR is narrower than in NRCanMET. Air temperature biases are clearly correlated to elevation differences between nearby stations and the corresponding grid elevation. With improvement in the latest version of CaSR spring temperatures are higher and less biased in version 3.1 than in version 2.1. Pixels near water or mixed water/land pixels tend to exhibit a stronger cold bias. Overall, the magnitude of the biases varies by temperature variable and region, emphasizing the need for validation of the dataset at a particular location.\nPrecipitation in CaSR is generally positively biased, and this bias tends to increase with distance from the assimilated in-situ stations.

    "text": "Flow of information\nA common observation from the workshops was that climate information typically follows a chain of use within organizations. It begins with initial users—often from water resources or meteorology teams—who collect climate data and possess strong knowledge of its limitations and biases. These users process or reconstruct the data before passing it along to other teams, such as those responsible for load forecasting or outage planning. However, critical information about the data’s limitations is often lost along the way, as each team tends to assume that the data they receive has already been validated and corrected for uncertainties.\nAnother category of climate information users includes those who rely on standards, such as design values from organizations like the CSA or internal norms. These users may not be familiar with the origins or limitations of the data but trust that the authoritative body behind the standards ensures its reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of decision-making challenge in the Workshops\nThe Sankey diagram below provides a preliminary overview of the applications discussed by participants during the workshops (across all organizations). Note: This is an early draft that includes only a limited set of applications.\nThe first set of nodes (leftmost column) represents the sectors involved in the decision-making challenges. The second column provides a brief description of the decision context. The third column highlights the climate variables associated with these challenges, and the final column outlines key characteristics identified by participants as essential for informed decision-making.\nPlease note that the values shown may exceed the number of visible incoming or outgoing flows. This indicates that certain links were cited multiple times across different decision-making contexts by participants.",

    "text": "Electricity demand is a vital component in the planning, operation, and resilience of power systems. Climate change is expected to alter electricity demand patterns by affecting not only patterns of temperature, such as mean temperature, number of temperature extremes, and seasonal variations, but also consumption behaviours across different sectors. Numerous studies project increased cooling demand during hotter summers and reduced heating demand during milder winters as this pattern have been consistently observed across multiple global regions (1,2,3,4,5). The magnitude and direction of these changes are strongly dependent on the region and latitude; for example, countries in warmer climates are expected to see higher overall demand growth due to increased cooling loads (6,7,8). Climate change also affects electricity consumption by sector and temporal demand profiles, including daily and seasonal variations. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors respond differently to climate drivers (9,10,11). Meanwhile, the timing of electricity demand is shifting as well, with studies projecting changes in peak load hours and seasonal peaks due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events (1,12,13).\nTo assess the impacts of climate change on electricity demand, different approaches have been employed. These include the use of climate projections from GCM and RCM combined with downscaling techniques to capture local climatic variability (14,2,12,15,4). Empirical models, such as regression-bases analyses, have been also used to estimate historical relationships between temperature and electricity use (6,7,3) , while simulation tools and energy-climate models are applied to explore future scenarios under different socio-economic and climatic conditions (9,15,11)."

For example, Crown Corporations may be legal reporting requirements stemming from their empowering legal act, publicly registered and traded corporations must produce financial reports for shareholders and some companies produce voluntary reports to build their social license. There are many different forms climate change related reporting can take for electrical utilities including annual ESG Reports, Sustainability Reports, Climate Change Plans, Corporate Strategies or annual Financial Reports.\nThe genesis of many climate related reports comes for the creation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) started by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015. The underlying driver for the creation of the TCFD was to provide financial markets “clear, comprehensive, high-quality information on the impacts of cliamte change”. In this way investors, insurers and others in the financial sector could properly understand the risks and opportunities their investments were facing from both the physical impacts of climate changes but also from the climate transition related to policy, legal and market changes to combat climate change. The TCFD produced a recommendation report in 2017(1) gaining widespread support. Having accomplished it’s task, the TCFD was disbanded in 2023 and the monitoring and progress of climate related disclosures was assigned to the IFRS Foundation. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) created two financial disclosure standards that incorporated the work of the TCFD.

These are voluntary international standards that provide guidance on how companies should disclose among other things their climate related risks and adaptation strategies.\nThe Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) has released two Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards (CSDS) to provide guidance to Canadian companies on financial disclosures.

These standards are also voluntary for publicly reporting companies until the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA) mandates climate related financial disclosures for Canadian companies. These standards do not apply to all utilities, where Crown Corporations in particular may have their own reporting requirements.\nAmong the key requirements of these standards is the reporting of climate related risks that a electrical utility faces and where possible monitoring those risks and the treatment thereof with metrics and targets.

Demand Forecasting is below!\nElectricity demand is a vital component in the planning, operation, and resilience of power systems. Climate change is expected to alter electricity demand patterns by affecting not only patterns of temperature, such as mean temperature, number of temperature extremes, and seasonal variations, but also consumption behaviours across different sectors. Numerous studies project increased cooling demand during hotter summers and reduced heating demand during milder winters as this pattern have been consistently observed across multiple global regions (1,2,3,4,5). The magnitude and direction of these changes are strongly dependent on the region and latitude; for example, countries in warmer climates are expected to see higher overall demand growth due to increased cooling loads (6,7,8). Climate change also affects electricity consumption by sector and temporal demand profiles, including daily and seasonal variations. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors respond differently to climate drivers (9,10,11). Meanwhile, the timing of electricity demand is shifting as well, with studies projecting changes in peak load hours and seasonal peaks due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events (1,12,13).\nTo assess the impacts of climate change on electricity demand, different approaches have been employed. These include the use of climate projections from GCM and RCM combined with downscaling techniques to capture local climatic variability (14,2,12,15,4). Empirical models, such as regression-bases analyses, have been also used to estimate historical relationships between temperature and electricity use (6,7,3) , while simulation tools and energy-climate models are applied to explore future scenarios under different socio-economic and climatic conditions (9,15,11).",

    "section": "Climate change drivers and affected electricity demand parameters",
    "text": "Climate change drivers and affected electricity demand parameters\n\nDemand parameters\nElectricity demand is governed by a set of interconnected parameters that respond to both climatic and non-climatic factors. Under climate change, demand parameters, such as annual electricity consumption, peak demand magnitude and its timing, and daily load profiles, are increasingly influenced by variations in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather.5 listed key demand parameters affected by climate change as (1) total annual demand, influencing long-term generation capacity, (2) size and timing of peak demand, driving reserve margin and infrastructure sizing, (3) spatial distribution , affecting transmission and distribution network planning, and (4) sectoral response capacity, determining how quickly end-users can adapt to changing thermal comfort needs.\nAmong all climatic variables, air temperature exerts the strongest impacts on electricity demand. The non-linear V-shaped (or U-shaped) relationship, where demand rises both at high and low temperatures due to cooling and heating needs, respectively, is well presented by using Cooling Degree Days (CDD) and Heating Degree Days (HDD) (16,12,17,18,19,2,3). CDD quantify the accumulated temperature above a comfort threshold (commmonly 18degC or 65degF) which are mainly correlated with air conditioning demand. HDD reflects the accumulated temperature below the comfort threshold to estimate electrically heating requirements. For instanct,1 found that climate change has affected most of the contiguous US after identifying that annual mean CDDs are increasing, leading to significant growth in both average and peak cooling demand, while HDDs are declining, resulting in reduced heating demand. Similarly,11 used national-scale adjustments to CDD and HDD to determine how climate-induced changes in the degree days would shift electricity consumption and peak capacity needs in Macedonia. In Canada,20 applied CDD and HDD projections from multiple downscaled climate models to estimate future changes in space heating and cooling loads across Ontario’s climate zones. Their results showed a consistent increase in CDD and decline in HDD, with implications for building retrofits and peak load planning.\nClimate change not only affects total energy use but also reshapes daily and seasonal demand profiles.12 demonstrated that summer peak hours are becoming longer, with higher temperatures intensifying late afternoon summer peaks from a case study of the Tennessee Valley Authority region.13 also confirmed that peak hours are increasing as a result of climate change in North American cities. Shifting seasonal demand to warmer summer and the demand being more sensitive to climatic conditions in summer are the most commonly observed patterns across studies and across the world (19,21,7,22,18,23,24,25).\nSocioeconomic drivers, such as population growth, urbanization, income levels, policy, and technological adoption (e.g., air conditioners, heat pumps, and thermal insulation), influence the response of electricity demand to temperature.2 demonstrated that population growth had a stronger effect on projected residential electricity demand with consumption potentially increasing nearly fivefold by the end of the century in California under high-growth scenarios. Using a stochastic modeling framework,4 fround that population growth along with economic growth were the most influential factor affecting electricity demand in Brazil.26 and27 similarly analyzed that population growth due to urbanization or migration can reshape electricity demand patterns and stress local infrastructure, especially when combined with rising temperatures.28 analyzed the income level as a demand parameter and found significant increases in total energy consumption in most developing countries.10 found that climate change increases the elasticity of demand to both price and weather variables, particularly in the residential and commercial sectors.11 further emphasizes the role of adaptive capacity and policy. The adaptation measures, such as investment in more efficient cooling technologies or demand side management, can mitigate the projected demand increases.\n\n\nSeasonal variations\nRising temperatures due to climate change have led to a significant in seasonal electricity demand, particularly by increasing cooling demand during summer and reducing heating needs during winter. This shifting trend has been widely documented across regional and global studies. For example,14 showed that electricity demand in the United States shows a strong nonlinear response to high temperatures, especially above 25-30 degC, driven mainly by demand for air conditioning. Similarly,28 also confirmed this global trend that there are steep increases in demand where air conditioning is rising due to climate change. Regional case studies, such as18 and6, have demonstrated that peak demand coincides more frequently with extreme heat days, stressing both power generation and distribution infrastructure. The anticipated rise in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves further amplifies this concerns, requiring investments in peak capacity, demand-side management, and adaptation strategies.11 projected increased summer cooling demand across European regions due to higher temperatures, while8 confirmed the similar rise in cooling demand in Cyprus.9 also found that seasonal peaks are shifting in the United States, with summer peaks becoming more dominant due to climate-induced changes in building energy use.\nHowever, while winters are projected to be warmer, the demand responses are more variable.13 introduced a classification of demand response profiles: a “V”-shaped response which is common in mid-latitude temperated cities, such as North America and Europe where demand increases at both high and low temperatures; increasing response where demand rises steadily with temperature, which can be shown in tropical cities; and unresponsive profile where minimal or no correlation between temperature and electricity demand.3 used multivariate regression in Europe to estimate electricity consumption changes and found that Northern and Central Europe will experience reduced heating demand in winter while Southern Europe will face increased cooling demand and higher costs in summer. This results in an increased annual electricity demand in Spain while it will decrease in Finland, Germany and France.5 analyzed how climate change could flatten winter peaks while enhancing summer peaks in the United Kingdom, suggesting that infrastructure planning should shift from winter-dominant to summer-dominant strategies.\n\n\nRegional variations\nThe impacts of climate change on electricity demand show considerable regional heterogeneity, followed by geographic location, climatic baseline, economic development, and infrastructure characteristics. A clear latitudinal pattern exists: countries at lower latitude are projected to have higher increases in electricity demand for cooling, while higher latitude regions may observe mixed outcomes due to the opposing effects of warmer winters and hotter summers. Similarly to the13’s classification,16 analyzed Temperature Response Functions (TRFs) across Europe by fitting the relationship between the electricity demand and temperature to three types of curves: linear decreasing curve for Northern European countries, linear curve with a horizontal segment for cold and intermediate climate countries, and V-shaped curve with a comfort zone for intermediate or warm countries where both heating and cooling demands are affected.\nRegional variations in electricity demand due to climate change across Japan show a clear dependency on latitude (19) Northern regions, such as Hokkaido and Tohoku will experience decreased annual electricity demand owing to reduced heating needs, whereas southern regions from Tokyo to Okinawa will see increased consumption due to extended cooling requirements. Transition zones near the border of the northern and southern regions presents a balance between reduced heading and increased cooling demands, while the transition zones are shifting northward as climate warming continues.29 also confirmed that there is a decrease of heating degree days in northern US while the increase of cooling degree days is significant in southern US.\nIn tropical regions, where average temperature are already high, even modest increases in temperature can trigger substantial rises in electricity use.6 found that rising temperatures will affect electricity demand for all warming levels due to increasing air conditioning needs, with low adaptive capacity exacerbating system stress in Niger.28 projected larger increases in energy consumption, primarily driven by higher frequency of high temperature extremes and the consequently increased cooling demand. However, in temperate regions, impacts on demand are mixed, varying based on local climate and socioeconomic conditions, as the demand can either increase or decrease depending on the local climate and geographic incidence of climate change (28).\n\n\nSectoral variations\nClimate change impacts electricity demands across sectors in different ways due to sector-specific end-use patterns, varying weather sensitivities, and adaptive capacities. Therefore, understanding differences in electricity demand patterns across sectors is essential for ensuring grid resilience under changing climate condistions.\nIn the residential sectors, electricity demand is particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, primarily due to the use of heating and cooling appliances to meet residents’ comfort expectations, which increase faster than the climate is changing (5).28 found that temperate regions, warming reduces heating needs, resulting in lower electricity consumption, especially in households using electricity-based heating systems, such as heat pumps. However, in tropical and warmer temperate zones, the demand for space cooling increases substantially with rising temperatures and humidity levels, leading to a net increase in electricity use in residential buildings.30 emphasized that while heating energy use intentisy may decline by 18-33%, cooling energy user intensity could rise by as much as 126% by 2070 in Canadian buildings.\nThe commercial sector is also highly climate-sensitive, primarily due to its dependence on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.11 projectec that under a warmer climate scenario, commercial electricity demand for cooling would increase, especially during peak summer periods, while the reduction in heating demand would be relatively minor.24 showed that commercial electricity demands would increase driven not only by higher consumption but also by rising electricity prices. This suggests that the commercial sector faces both quantity- and price-based vulnerabilities under climate change.\nThe industrial sector shows more heterogenous responses. Its demand is generally less directly related to air temperature, but certain processes, particularly those requireing climate-controlled environments, are affected by heat.10 showed that electricity demand in the industrial sector remains relatively price-inelastic and shows modest temperature sensitivity compared to other sectors. However, long-term changes in the demand may emerge through indirect pathways, such as workforce comfort requirements, advances in technology, or regulatory standards.\nIn the transportation sector, electricity demand is currently limited as the sector remains largely dependent on petroleum. However, with increasing electrification of transport systems, future electricity demand is expected to rise significantly (28)10 also noted that while the sector’s electricity use is still low, it is highly responsive to economic and price signals, suggesting future variability under combined climate and market pressures.",

These data are primarily sourced from Glocal Climate Models (GCMs), which simulate the Earth’s climate system based on physical laws and boundary conditions. GCMs provide long-term projections of atmospheric variables such as temperature and precipitation, which are critical inputs to electricity demand models, especially in studies focusing on temperatrue-sensitive loads like heating and cooling.\nMany studies assessing future electricity demand have employed GCM outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases, particularly CMIP5 and CMIP6. For example,12 temperature projections from 20 CMIP5 GCMs to simulate intra-day electricity demand shifts. Similarly,20 relied on GCMs from thh North American CORDEX, which has 23 CMIP6 to assess building heating and cooling demand in Ontario, while16 drew on CMIP5 from the EURO-CORDEX to construct the temperature response function.1 used ERA5 reanalysis data to analyze changes in peak and average thermal demand across the contiguous US. To explore a range of potential future emissions trajectories, studies commonly apply Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). These scenarios (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) represent different greenhouse gas concentration trajectories based on varying degrees of pathway scenarios. The selection of RCPs provides a structured way to assess electricity demand sensitivity under different warming levels. For instance,16 employed three major RCPs (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) to examine how demand profiles shift across Europe.7 and31 similarly applied four RCPs including RCP6.0 to assess electricity demand responses under climate change, respectively. While4 and14 applied two RCPs (4.5 and 8.5),15 only used the worst pathway, RCP8.5, to investigate climate change impact on energy demand through building-urban-atmosphere simulations. On the other hand,20 evaluated changes of HDDs and CDDs for buildings’ heating and cooling demand under the intermediate scenario, RCP4.5. Given that GCMs operate at relatively coarse spatial resolutions (typically 100-250 km), their outputs are often inadequate for regional scale modeling. To address this, studies apply downscaling techniques that bridge the resolution gap between GCM outputs and local demand drivers. While statistical downscaling relates large-scale GCM outputs to local climate variables using historical observations (e.g.,4,14,12, and30), dynamical downscaling method uses Regional Climate Models (RCMs) to simulate climate at finer scales (typically 10-50 km) (e.g.,8,15, and30). While, statistical downscaling methods are computationally efficient, these methods may fail to capture complex feedbacks and changes in variability or extremes.\nDespite the advances in climate data usage, the literature reveals several challenges and limitations. First, the choice of climate models and RCPs is not always clearly justified or consistent across studies, making comparative assessment difficult. Second, biases in raw climate model outputs can distrot demand projections if not corrected or validated using observations. Third, the integration of climate data with energy system models often lacks explicit treatment of uncertainty.12 noted that climate variables alone explain a limited portion of electricity demand variability as socioeconomic, behavioral, and technological factors may play considerable roles. Additionally, while many studies have applied a single or limited number of climate models, ensemble approaches or various combinations of GCMs and RCMs, as used by31,14,15,12,20,32, and6, are therefore essential to improve the robustness of results.\n\nSimulation models: energy-climate models\nEmpirical methods: regression analysis",

    "text": "Ontario’s electricity demand\nIn Ontario, the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) is responsible for the stable and reliable operation of power system and electricity market. According to the recent Annual Planning Outlook (APO) (33), Ontario’s electricity demand is influenced by both growth-inducing and demand-tempering factors. On the growth side, demand is expected to rise significantly due to expansion of industrial electric vehicle production, an increasing number of data centres driven by artificial intelligence services, ongoing decarbonization and electrification initiatives, and continued population growth and household formation. Conversely, demand growth may be moderated by energy savings from energy demand-side management (eDSM) programs, slower growth of agricultural greenhouse sector, and rising living costs and economic uncertainty. As a result of these offsetting factors, grid-level electricity demand in Ontario remained relatively flat over the past decade. However, a substantial increase is projected: net summer seasonal peak demand is forecasted to grow by 48%, and net winter seasonal peak demand by 57, by 2050. It is important to note that these projections are based on a normal weather scenario, which assumes average climatic conditions. This approach may introduce potential limitations, as it does not account for increasing weather variability due to changing climate. Weather-sensitive demand, such as heating and cooling, is strongly influenced by actual weather conditions, which are expected to include more frequent heatwaves and cold snaps. Therefore, the application of various climate scenarios is recommended to better capture uncertainty and inform more resilient electricity system planning.",

Indirect increase from the relationship between climate indicators (e.g. extreme heat) and penetration rates of some technologies (e.g. residential air conditioning).\nGeneration Forecasting (Hydro, Nuclear, Solar, Thermal, Wind) (deep dive) (how does climate data impact generation forecasting processes) It will be important to differentiate long-term climate projection from medium-term forecasting.\nCapacity Expansion Modelling (summary of how this process works, but climate data interactions come from Demand and Generation forecasts)\nResource Adequacy Planning (summary of how this process works, but climate data interactions come from Demand and Generation forecasts)\n\nOperations Planning\n\nElectrical System Operations (deep / intermediate dive) (what seasonal to annual data go into this process?) CondiderFERC/NERC documents pertaining to ambient ratings and extreme temperature scenarios for use in transmission planning. We should confirm with system operators whether or not this should be an area of focus.\nOutage scheduling (What factors are considered for scheduling outages - linked to generation and demand forecast o no real climate data in isolation) From an HQ perspective, most of outage scheduling occurs during summer. This goes beyond generation + demand forecast, but also includes considerations such as redundancy during forest fire season, workers capacity during extreme heat, ambient ratings for transmission lines, degradation rates of components, etc. Just a random thought here: while outage scheduling relies on other factors and no climate data are needed in isolation, it could be interesting to map the interactions between those different activities to better capture which ones serve as inputs for which ones.\nVegetation Management (I think we do a light review of this topic but not a deep dive) Integrate forest fire.\nWorker safety (reference some generic material on safety and health implications of CC) I see two components to this question. 1) Safety and 2) Productivity. Increased heat stress should decrease productivity which might represent a financial or operational risk to some utilities. There is material on quantifying the cost of heat-induced loss of productivity that should be referenced as well.\n\nInfrastructure Planning and Asset Management\n\nConstruction (focus here is the temporary activities during construction. For example a coffer dam doesn’t have the same design criteria as a permanent dam)\nDam Safety Review\nNuclear Safety Review What do you think about wrapping Dam Safety and Nuclear Safety Reviews into a section Infrastructure Design and Review? Effectively, these are a detailed asset condition review and a design review. The actual ‘climate data’ related activities are the same from a DSR or new dam design for example. I think it could make sense to group DSR and NSRs together but somewhat on the fence about including design. While they may have similar data needs, the two activities (designing a new asset vs reviewing the safety of an existing asset) could be quite unique and worth differentiating.\nInfrastructure Condition Assessment & Investment Prioritization (can review some general literature on asset management and tie it to operations challenges and design reviews)\nInfrastructure Design (Hydro, Thermal/Nuclear, Transmission & Distribution) (deep dive) (Do we break these out? We are currently thinking to do a mix of standards/practices and some literature on extremes that inform design parameters. For example, there might not be much on pole design and climate change, but we can see who winds are expected to change and cross reference that with pole design practices. From the perspective of this project the deeper dive will be in the climate data the influence pole design) Do we separate out these asset types? We could have a separate “chapter” on hydro, T&D, etc. However, all generating stations have transformers as does T&D, so we could talk once about extreme temperature as a design value and how it interacts with each of these types of stations. The same is true of extreme flooding. We could repeat sections for each asset type or talk about how it affects each asset. Because the project is focused on climate data, I am leaning towards being able to do a deeper literature review on climate extremes and then relate that back to design values. I am open to others’ thoughts on this structure? I think organizing by climate event makes sense and then pointing to the various types of assets and specific indices used in design… however I’m a bit biased to the climate science side of things. From a design practitioner’s perspective, it might be more intuitive to have a section pertaining to their specific assets. I guess we need to think about who the intended audience is and if there’s a way to find a balance. We could also engage some of the workshop attendees involved in design to get more direct feedback on preferences. I like the idea to survey some workshop attendees on their preference.\nSupport supply chain decision-making (short summary talking about supply chain vulnerabilities)\nLicensing, Impact & Environmental Assessments How much is warranted here? We have three deeper dive topics already and the use of climate data for an EA/IA could be very wide reaching depending on the topic. I think a short summary is suitable here (similar to other non deep dive topics). In some cases there will already be guidance documentation like ECCC’s SACC that we can point to. Is this where content on Indigenous Knowledge would be addressed, or is the vision for a separate section? A topic of interest here should we want to go deeper that reference general guidance documentation would be to look at the question from the cumulative impact of cc + project standpoint. This is where I believe there is a gap in knowledge, but I have the feeling that the gap is not so much from a climate data perspective as much as from a methodological or M&E framework standpoint.\n\nAssurance, Reporting and Disclosures\n\nEnterprise Risk Management (Short overview of generic ERM practices. Climate data comes from infrastructure reviews or demand/generation forecasts)\nESG/Sustainability Reporting (Short overview of ESG reporting. The actual climate data from other areas informs this one.) Would climate related financial disclosures fit into ERM or ESG topic? I think it’s worth addressing this somewhere as it may become a more pressing topic in the foreseeable future which will require climate data. Especially given that standards focus on the reporting side of the disclosure and not as much on the analysis side of it. I feel that there is a high level of variance in the quality of information that is provided in ESG reporting, and I believe that this is partly induced by the variance in the quality (and utilization) of climate data.",

    "text": "Electricity demand is a vital component in the planning, operation, and resilience of power systems. Climate change is expected to alter electricity demand patterns by affecting not only temperature characteristics, such as mean temperature, frequency of temperature extremes, and seasonal variability, but also consumption behaviours across different sectors. Numerous studies project increased cooling demand during hotter summers and reduced heating demand during milder winters as this pattern has been consistently observed across multiple global regions (1,2,3,4,5).\nThe magnitude and direction of these changes are strongly dependent on region and latitude. For example, countries in warmer climates are expected to experience higher overall demand growth due to increased cooling loads (6,7,8). Climate change also influences electricity consumption by sector and alters temporal demand profiles, including daily and seasonal variations. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors respond differently to climate drivers (9,10,11). Furthermore, the timing of electricity demand is shifting, with studies projecting changes in peak load hours and seasonal peaks due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events (1,12,13).\nTo assess the impacts of climate change on electricity demand, various approaches have been employed. These include the use of climate projections from General Circulation Models (or Global Climate Models, GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs), often combined with downscaling techniques to capture local climatic variability (14,2,12,15,4). Empirical models, such as regression-based analyses, have also been used to estimate historical relationships between temperature and electricity use (6,7,3). Additionally, simulation tools and integrated energy-climate models are applied to explore future scenarios under varying socio-economic and climatic conditions (9,15,11)."

    "text": "Climate change drivers and affected electricity demand parameters\n\nDemand parameters\nElectricity demand is governed by a set of interconnected parameters that respond to both climatic and non-climatic factors. Under climate change, demand parameters, such as annual electricity consumption, peak demand magnitude and its timing, and daily load profiles, are increasingly influenced by variations in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather.5 identified key demand parameters affected by climate change as (1) total annual demand, influencing long-term generation capacity, (2) size and timing of peak demand, driving reserve margin and infrastructure sizing, (3) spatial distribution, affecting transmission and distribution network planning, and (4) sectoral response capacity, determining how quickly end-users can adapt to changing thermal comfort needs.\nAmong all climatic variables, air temperature exerts the strongest impacts on electricity demand. The non-linear V-shaped (or U-shaped) relationship, where demand rises both at high and low temperatures due to cooling and heating needs, respectively, is well presented by using Cooling Degree Days (CDD) and Heating Degree Days (HDD) (16,12,17,18,19,2,3). The CDD quantifies the accumulated temperature above a comfort threshold (commmonly 18degC or 65degF), which are mainly correlated with air conditioning demand. The HDD reflects the accumulated temperature below the comfort threshold to estimate electric heating requirements. For instance,1 found that climate change has affected most of the contiguous US after identifying that annual mean CDDs are increasing, leading to significant growth in both average and peak cooling demand, while HDDs are declining, resulting in reduced heating demand. Similarly,11 used national-scale adjustments to CDD and HDD to determine how climate-induced changes in the degree days would shift electricity consumption and peak capacity needs in Macedonia. In Canada,20 applied CDD and HDD projections from multiple downscaled climate models to estimate future changes in space heating and cooling loads across Ontario’s climate zones. Their results showed a consistent increase in CDD and decline in HDD, with implications for building retrofits and peak load planning.\nClimate change not only affects total energy use but also reshapes daily and seasonal demand profiles.12 demonstrated that summer peak hours are becoming longer, with higher temperatures intensifying late afternoon summer peaks in a case study of the Tennessee Valley Authority region.13 also confirmed that peak hours are increasing as a result of climate change in North American cities. Shifting seasonal demand to warmer summer, and the demand being more sensitive to climatic conditions in summer are the most commonly observed patterns across studies and across the world (19,21,7,22,18,23,24,25).\nSocioeconomic drivers, such as population growth, urbanization, income levels, policy, and technological adoption (e.g., air conditioners, heat pumps, and thermal insulation), influence the response of electricity demand to temperature.2 demonstrated that population growth had a stronger effect on projected residential electricity demand with consumption potentially increasing nearly fivefold by the end of the century in California under high-growth scenarios. Using a stochastic modelling framework,4 found that population growth along with economic growth were the most influential factors affecting electricity demand in Brazil.26 and27 similarly analyzed that population growth due to urbanization or migration can reshape electricity demand patterns and stress local infrastructure, especially when combined with rising temperatures.28 analyzed income level as a demand parameter and found significant increases in total energy consumption in most developing countries.10 found that climate change increases the elasticity of demand to both price and weather variables, particularly in the residential and commercial sectors.11 further emphasized the role of adaptive capacity and policy. Adaptation measures, such as investment in more efficient cooling technologies or demand side management, can mitigate the projected demand increases.\n\n\nSeasonal variations\nRising temperatures due to climate change have led to a significant shift in seasonal electricity demand, particularly by increasing cooling demand during summer and reducing heating needs during winter. This shifting trend has been widely documented across regional and global studies. For example,14 showed that electricity demand in the United States exhibits a strong nonlinear response to high temperatures, especially above 25-30 degC, driven mainly by demand for air conditioning. Similarly,28 also confirmed this global trend that there are steep increases in demand where air conditioning adoption is rising due to climate change. Regional case studies, such as18 and6, have demonstrated that peak demand coincides more frequently with extreme heat days, stressing both power generation and distribution infrastructure. The anticipated rise in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves further amplifies these concerns, requiring investments in peak capacity, demand-side management, and adaptation strategies.11 projected increased summer cooling demand across European regions due to higher temperatures, while8 confirmed a similar rise in cooling demand in Cyprus.9 also found that seasonal peaks are shifting in the United States, with summer peaks becoming more dominant due to climate-induced changes in building energy use.\nHowever, while winters are projected to be warmer, the demand responses are more variable.13 introduced a classification of demand response profiles: a “V”-shaped response which is common in mid-latitude temperate cities such as those in North America and Europe, where demand increases at both high and low temperatures; an increasing response, where demand rises steadily with temperature, which can be typically shown in tropical cities; and an unresponsive profile, where minimal or no correlation exists between temperature and electricity demand.3 used multivariate regression in Europe to estimate electricity consumption changes and found that Northern and Central Europe will experience reduced heating demand in winter, while Southern Europe will face increased cooling demand and higher costs in summer. This results in increased annual electricity demand in Spain, while it will decrease in Finland, Germany, and France.5 analyzed how climate change could flatten winter peaks while enhancing summer peaks in the United Kingdom, suggesting that infrastructure planning should shift from winter-dominant to summer-dominant strategies.\n\n\nRegional variations\nThe impacts of climate change on electricity demand show considerable regional heterogeneity, influenced by geographic location, climatic baseline, economic development, and infrastructure characteristics. A clear latitudinal pattern exists: countries at lower latitudes are projected to have higher increases in electricity demand for cooling, while higher latitude regions may observe mixed outcomes due to the opposing effects of warmer winters and hotter summers. Similar to the13’s classification,16 analyzed Temperature Response Functions (TRFs) across Europe by fitting the relationship between electricity demand and temperature to three types of curves: a linear decreasing curve for Northern European countries, a linear curve with a horizontal segment for cold and intermediate climate countries, and a V-shaped curve with a comfort zone for intermediate or warm countries, where both heating and cooling demands are affected.\nRegional variations in electricity demand due to climate change across Japan show a clear dependency on latitude (19) Northern regions, such as Hokkaido and Tohoku, will experience decreased annual electricity demand owing to reduced heating needs, whereas southern regions from Tokyo to Okinawa will see increased consumption due to extended cooling requirements. Transition zones near the boundary of the northern and southern regions present a balance between reduced heading and increased cooling demands, while these transition zones are shifting northward as climate warming continues.29 also confirmed a decrease in HDD in the northern US, while the increase of CDD is significant in the southern US.\nIn tropical regions, where average temperatures are already high, even modest increases in temperature can trigger substantial rises in electricity use.6 found that rising temperatures will affect electricity demand across all warming levels due to increasing air conditioning needs, with low adaptive capacity exacerbating system stress in Niger.28 projected larger increases in energy consumption, primarily driven by higher frequency of extreme temperatures and the resulting increased cooling demand. However, in temperate regions, impacts on demand are mixed, varying based on local climate and socioeconomic conditions, as demand can either increase or decrease depending on local climate and geographic incidence of climate change (28).\n\n\nSectoral variations\nClimate change impacts electricity demand across sectors in different ways due to sector-specific end-use patterns, varying weather sensitivities, and adaptive capacities. Therefore, understanding differences in electricity demand patterns across sectors is essential for ensuring grid resilience under changing climate conditions.\nIn the residential sector, electricity demand is particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, primarily due to the use of heating and cooling appliances to meet residents’ comfort expectations, which increase faster than the climate is changing (5).28 found that temperate regions, warming reduces heating needs, resulting in lower electricity consumption, especially in households using electricity-based heating systems, such as heat pumps. However, in tropical and warmer temperate zones, the demand for space cooling increases substantially with rising temperatures and humidity levels, leading to a net increase in electricity use in residential buildings.30 emphasized that while heating energy use intensity may decline by 18-33%, cooling energy user intensity could rise by as much as 126% by 2070 in Canadian buildings.\nThe commercial sector is also highly climate-sensitive, primarily due to its dependence on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.11 projected that under a warmer climate scenario, commercial electricity demand for cooling would increase, especially during peak summer periods, while the reduction in heating demand would be relatively minor.24 showed that commercial electricity demands would increase, driven not only by higher consumption but also by rising electricity prices. This suggests that the commercial sector faces both quantity- and price-based vulnerabilities under climate change.\nThe industrial sector shows more heterogeneous responses.

    "section": "Downscaling methods",
    "text": "Downscaling methods\nGiven that GCMs operate at relatively coarse spatial resolutions (typically 100-250 km), their outputs are often inadequate for regional scale modeling. Because electricity planning is typically sensitive to finer-scale temperature variations, it is essential that climate inputs local meteorological conditions with sufficient detail. To address this, two primary categories of downscaling techniques are widely applied in the literature: statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling.\nStatistical downscaling establishes empirical relationships between large-scale GCM variables and local climate observations, using historical data as a training base. These methods are computationally efficient and have been widely used where computational resources or high-resolution models are limited. For example,30 employed CCWorldWeatherGen and WeatherShift™ tools to statistically downscale GCMs and generated site-specific future weather data in Canada. Similarly,12 and14 applied the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method to statistically downscale CMIP5 GCM projections for United States. The resulting high-resolution weather data were used to simulate changes in electricity demand profiles under a warming climate.4 also used trend-preserving statistical downscaling method to estimate climate-induced changes across Brazil.\nIn contrast, dynamical downscaling embeds higher-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) within GCMs to explicitly simulate regional climate processes. This approache is particularly beneficial for capturing terrain-driven weather dynamics and localized extremes. Within the North American COPRDEX (NA-CORDEX),20 applied multiple RCMs including CRCM5, RCA4, RegCM4, WRF, CanRCM4, and HIRHAM5 driven by GCMs like HadGEM2-ES, CanESM2, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR. EC-EARTH, and GFDL-ESM2M, to project changes in building-level heating and cooling demands in Ontario. Similarly,16 used the ERMO2009 RCM under the EURO-CORDEX project to model electricity demand changes across European countries, providing spatially disaggregated insights into future temperature-response dynamics. These dynamical approaches offer more physically consistent outputs than statistical methods while a higher computational cost is required.\nNevertheless, dynamical downscaling is not without limitations. Bias correction is typically necessary because RCM outputs may deviate from observed climatology. Moreover, the selection of GCM-RCM combinations can introduce additional variability into the projections, as a concern emphasized by33. To address this, ensemble approaches using multiple model combinations have become more common to capture the spread of plausible futures and quantify projection uncertainty, although this adds additional computational costs."

    "text": "Modeling Frameworks\nClimate data such as GCMs and RCMs prepared for the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution are integrated into models that simulate or estimate electricity demand responses to climatic variables. The literature broadly categorizes these models into two groups: empirical models ,which are typically data-driven, and simulation-based models, which are process-oriented or scenario-based. These approaches differ in their methodological structure and are selected based on the availability of data, the spatial and temporal scale of analysis, and the objective of the study or project.\nEmpirical models typically use regression-based methods to quantify the historical relationship between electricity demand and weather variables, mostly temperature.2 used a simple log-linear regression models to estimate residential demand sensitivity and climate change impacts estimation in California.12 developed empirical load models based on hourly utility data and downscaled weather variables to simulate load variability under future climate scenarios.10 extended this approach across multiple sectors and climate variables to evaluate sectoral demand elasticity and response behavior in the United States. While empirical models are statistically robust and adequate for retrospective analysis, they are inherently constrained by the historical range of observed conditions and may not fully capture adaptive or nonlinear responses to future extremes.\nSimulation models, on the other hand, allow to explore prospective scenarios by embedding climate variables within energy system or physics models. These include tools like EnergyPlus for building-level simulations (as used by30) and energy system optimization models such as MARKAL (as applied in11). Simulation models offer the advantage of flexibility in exploring technological, behavioral and policy adaptations under different emissions and socioeconomic pathways.15 incorporated building-urban-atmosphere interaction models to simulate energy demand responses under urban heat island effects, demonstrating how climate-urban feedbacks can influence spatial energy use patterns.34 modeled electricity system planning under hydro-climatic uncertainty using robust optimization techniques, highlighting the importance of integrating demand and supply-side climate risks."

    "section": "Demand forecasting",
    "text": "Demand forecasting\nElectricity demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in the planning of power systems, enabling system operators and utilities to balance supply and demand, ensure reliability, and plan future infrastructure investments. As Canada pursues electrification in response to climate policy and decarbonization goals, understanding the methodologies and assumptions underlying demand forecasting becomes more essential. While the interdependence of provincial grids through initiatives such as Canadian Energy Strategy (35) enables robust electricity systme planning, demand forecasting in Canada is largely decentralized, with each province or territory adopting methodologies tailored to its own regulatory, climatic, and socioeconomic context.\n\nMethodological approaches\nIn Ontario, the demand forecasting methodology is developed and maintained by the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO,36). The IESO applies a multivariate econometric model that establishes statistical relationships between electricity demand and a set of explanatory variables like weather, economic, and demographic factors. The model is structured to simulate hourly electricity demand at both provincial and zonal levels, reflecting the operational needs of the bulk power system. Specifically, the explanatory variables include weather inputs (e.g., temperature, dew point, cloud cover, and wind speed), calendar effects (e.g., weekends, holidays, and daylight duration), economic and demographic conditions (e.g., population and employment). Forecasts also account for embedded generation, load modifiers, conservation acts, and large step loads. The IESO issues demand forecasts under two main scenarios: firm demand and planned demand. Firm demand, which is used for planning and operating the power system, includes demands committed through the connection assessment process, while planned demand adds potential loads with less certainty to reflect future risk.\nIn Québec, Hydro-Québec Distribution applies the demand forecasting method as part of its ten-year supply plan (Hydro-QuébecDistribution2020?). The forecast integrates the effects of key developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic, increased efforts on decarbonization, and the results of calls for proposals in emerging markets like blockchain and data centres. The approach is sector-based, with demand forecasted separately for the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, incorporating elements such as electrification of space and water heating, the rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, and the slower growth of solar photovoltaic systems. Climate variability is explicitly embedded in the demand forecast through the use of standard deviations that quantify both forecast uncertainty and climatic uncertainty. Methodological adjustments have been made to improve the treatment of extreme weather conditions in calculating demand risks, although the impact on the overall climate-related uncertainty was found to be limited.\nManitoba Hydro also forecasts electricity demand using a sector-based approach (37). Residential, commercial, and industrial customer classes are forecasted separately based on historical energy use per customer, customer counts, and expected trends. In the recent plan (38), climate change is embedded in demand forecasting primarily through the development of scenarios that reflect varying paces of decarbonization and decentralization. These scenarios are not forecasts, but structured representations of possible energy futures based on different assumptions for key variables such as EV adoption, space heating technologies, economic growth, and customer self-generation. In other words, although climate variables such as temperature changes or extreme weather events are not explicitly accounted for in the demand module, the forecasting model incorporates climate policy and technological adoption as indirect drivers of demand transformation.\nBC Hydro’s demand forecasting approach is based on its long-term load forecasting methodology, which projects future electricity demand by incorporating a range of factors including demographic trends, economic activity, energy efficiency and electrification. The forecast includes detailed assessments of expected electricity use by residential, commercial, and industrial customer classes, and integrates anticipated impacts from transportation electrification, building decarbonization, and government climate policies. Climate change is not treated as a separate scenario but is explicitly embedded in the demand forecast through its impact on weather-sensitive electricity demand.\n\n\nForecasting drivers\nElectricity demand forecasting across Canadian provinces is driven by a set of common factors that are broadly consistent, although the implementation and emphasis of each factor may differ depending on regional contexts. These common drivers include population and economic growth, weather conditions, electrification trends, and the impacts of energy efficiency and demand-side management programs.\nPopulation and economic growth are key determinants of electricity demand across provinces. Manitoba Hydro integrates annual population growth into its residential forecast, alongside real gross domestic product (GDP) and employment projections that feed into residential and industrial demand models (37). In Ontario, the IESO uses demographic projections and economic forecasts, integrating these forecasts into multivariate regression models (36). Weather normalization is applied to account for temperature-sensitive demand, such as heating and cooling. Manitoba Hydro uses a 20-year average to establish baseline weather conditions, with adjustments for heating and cooling degree days reflecting projected changes in climate and electrification of heating (37). The IESO employs multiple weather scenarios (i.e., normal, mild, and extreme) and uses monthly normalization to simulate demand variability in seasonal extremes (36). As weather scenarios are based on historical data rather than forecast, Load Forecast Uncertainty (LFU) is employed to account for the changes in demand due to weather volatility.\nElectrification of space heating, transportation, and industrial activity is also identified as a major long-term driver of demand forecasting. The IESO projects that electricity demand will increase by 75% by 2050 due to electrification , particularly in transportation (e.g., EV and rail), space heating, and industrial fuel switching (39). Manitoba Hydro includes heat pumps and EV adoption through end-use profiles and sector-specific forecasts. BC Hydro developed contingency scenarios by considering the accelerated electrification scenario, which assumes full implementation of the electrification plan and provincial greenhouse gas reduction targets, leading to significant demand growth (40). In addition, the inclusion of energy savings from demand-side management (DSM), the influence of customers’ electricity pricing responses, and the consideration of broader provincial energy or climate policies are key components of long-term demand forecasting.\n\n\nAccounting for climate change in demand forecasting\nThe IESO (36) explicitly considers both transitional and physical climate uncertainties in its demand forecast. Transitional climate uncertainties refer to the demand-side impact driven by policies, regulations, and societal shifts aimed at mitigating climate change. For example, the 2024 amendment to the Electricity Act empowers the IESO to promote electrification and efficiency measures that reduce overall emissions. However, the pace and extent of electrification , particularly in weather-sensitive technologies like heat pumps, remain uncertain. Physical climate uncertainties arise from the divergence between historical weather patterns and emerging climate conditions, which directly affect temperature-sensitive electricity consumption. As electrification increases, the system becomes more weather-responsive, amplifying the risks associated with climate variability. The IESO distinguishes between acute risks, such as more frequent or intense heatwaves and cold snaps, which mainly affect peak demand, and chronic risks, such as rising average temperatures, which influence total energy use. The IESO acknowledges that relying solely on historical weather data is insufficient under changing climate and has committed to developing climate-informed weather variables and analytical tools for future forecasts. These enhancements aim to better incorporate climate change-induced uncertainties in demand forecasting.\nIn Manitoba Hydro’s demand forecasting (37), climate considerations are indirectly embedded through weather normalization and scenario-based electrification modelling, but explicit integration of future climate change projections remains limited. It applies a normal weather adjustment, defined as a 20-year historical average, to remove the influence of short-term weather variability from historical load data used in model calibration. This adjusted baseline is used to estimate temperature-sensitive loads such as space heating and cooling. Additionally, forecasts are built using hourly end-use profiles that reflect heating and cooling loads, including the adoption of electrified technologies like heat pumps and EVs. These end-use models incorporate seasonal and diurnal variability, capturing how temperature-related usage patterns will evolve with increased electrification. However, the load forecast does not explicitly incorporate climate change projections, such as those from GCMs, nor does it adjust future HDD and CDD based on projected warming trends. Although electrification scenarios reflect potential policy-driven adoption of heat pumps and air conditioning, these are typically modelled without changing climate conditions. As such, the forecasts do not account for chronic climate shifts (e.g., rising average temperature) or acute events (e.g., heatwaves) that could reshape the seasonal and peak demand profiles over time.\nBC Hydro also recognizes the relevance of climate change in electricity demand forecasting, particularly in the context of long-term planning. However, the direct integration of climate data remains minimal (40). The plan indicated that climate change is expected to reduce long-term energy and capacity demand by approximately 2% due to warmer winters and reduced space heating needs, while the decline due to changing climate is less significant compared to other factors. Electrification trends driven by climate policy goals have been more important to demand growth scenarios, such as the Accelerated Electrification Scenario. These scenarios reflect the policy response to climate change, not the physical impacts of the changing climate itself. For example, anticipated demand increases are modelled as part of these potential pathways. This represents an indirect response to climate change through decarbonization strategy, while demand-side impacts of climate change are not directly reflected.\nIn sum, while the relevance of climate change to electricity demand is well recognized, it is primarily reflected as a policy driver through electrification scenarios rather than as a physical driver of temperature-sensitive electricity use. The continued reliance on historical weather data, coupled with the limited integration of climate-adjusted demand profiles, presents a constraint in accurately modelling future electricity demand under changing climate conditions."

    "text": "Methodology\nERA5-Land is produced under a single simulation of the land component of the ERA5 climate reanalysis, without coupling to the atmospheric module of the ECMWF’s Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and without data assimilation. The low atmospheric forcing is provided by the ERA5 reanalysis, with additional lapse-rate correction. The core of ERA5-Land is the Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land incorporating land surface hydrology (H-TESSEL). Because it runs without data assimilation, it makes it computationally affordable for relatively quick updates. For example, if significant improvements of the land surface model are implemented, the whole or part of the dataset can be reprocessed in a relatively short period. Updates are possible in case improved auxiliary datasets are used as input for the production.\nProduction of ERA5-Land is not produced as a single continuous segment, but instead as three segments: Stream-1 (2001 onwards), Stream-2 (1981-2000), and Stream-3 (1950-1980). This is because it allows parallel production of data enabling sooner public access to the data, and because the atmospheric forcings used by ERA5-Land is derived from ERA5, thus needing corresponding completed ERA5 segment. Each stream is initialized with various meteorological fields from ERA5 (temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation, etc.). While ERA5-Land does not assimilate observations directly, they are introduced via the ERA5 atmospheric forcings. These forcings are adjusted using ERA5 derived lapse rates before being integrated with the ECMWF Carbon Hydrology-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CHTESSEL) land surface model. This is done in 24-hour cycles, generating hourly outputs and the evolution of the land surface state and water and energy fluxes. For further details of the assimilation system used to obtain the ERA5 atmospheric forcings, please see the ERA5 document previously prepared by the CCCS.\nUncertainty estimate: Currently, ERA5-Land variable uncertainty estimates are those corresponding to ERA5. ERA5 uncertainty estimate is sampled by a 10-member lower-resolution Ensemble Data Assimilation (EDA) which provides background-error estimates for the deterministic HRES 4D-Var Data Assimilation system. The analysis method is the same for each EDA member and follows that of the HRES. Each member (except the control) is run with different random perturbations added to the observations. Likewise, the model physical tendencies are perturbed in the short forecasts that link subsequent analysis windows. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\nThe original plan was to apply the same methodology ERA5-Land to provide an estimate of the uncertainty fields as was done for ERA5. However, the uncertainty was estimated to be extremely low, and would have assigned unrealistically high confidence to the ERA5-Land variables. As such, it is recommended to use the corresponding ERA5 uncertainty estimates for the time being until further studies are done."

A list of ‘known issues’ is maintained at the online documentation.\nInformation on land surface model: The land surface model of the ERA5-Land was operational in 2018 with the IFS model cycle 45r1. While most of the changes from the IFS Cy41R2 used in ERA5 are primarily technical, there were a few improvements to various fields: 1) the parameterization of the soil thermal conductivity was updated to take the ice component of frozen soil into consideration, 2) conservation of the soil-water balance was fixed and improved, and 3) rain over snow is now accounted for and is not accumulated in snow pack. Furthermore, a bug exists in IFS Cy41R2, that affects potential evapotranspiration (PET) flux calculations over forests and deserts, has been corrected in ERA5-Land, and unlike ERA5, ERA5-Land PET is an available dataset. However, PET is now determined by assuming a vegetation type of crops and no soil moisture stress. These assumptions may not be always realistic, and therefore PET should be used cautiously. This is unlikely to affect ERA5-Land 2 m temperature in Canada’s north, but the user should be aware of the reason for this update. More information on the CHTESSEL land surface model used in ERA5-Land can be found in Muñoz-Sabater et al., (2021, preprint)."

The datasets incorporate adjustments to the historical station data for non-climatic factors (e.g., station relocations, site exposure, instrumentation changes, observer, observing procedures) to ensure consistency and reliability.

The data are collected from Reference Climate Stations and some Canadian Aviation Weather Service stations. They are different from the official Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) in situ records and should not be used for legal purposes. The AHCCD station IDs are the same as those of the MSC stations to facilitate comparison.\nThe data are point data and may not represent the climate values for a larger region. Althought the time series are quality controlled there may be missing values in the data, varying by variable station and time (see figure above).\nIn some instances AHCCD data from nearby stations may be merged to create a longer record. The length of the records for individual stations may vary significantly, and some records are from stations that have been closed.\nThe non-climatic shifts in tempertature data are identified by statistically comparing adjacent stations. Station metadata are investigated to understand non-climatic causes and determine a corrective measure if a shift has been identified. A recurring adjustment is related to the change in observing time at principal stations in 1961. The correction of the temperature record results in a slightly stronger warming in the homogenized dataset than the unadjusted data: For southern Canada this trend changed from 1.32° to 1.62°C for 1900–2018, with a smaller change for all of Canada.1\nPrecipitation data correction accounts for a number of known errors in precipitation measurements, such as underestimation of actually gauged precipitation and limits to the minimum measurable amount. Snow measurements adjust for varying snow density depending on geographical location. Updates of historical adjusted precipitation has been interrupted since Autumn 2017. This hiatus is related to the integration of manual observations to an increasingly automated station network. Updates are planned to be resumed, but no time has been specified.\nFor wind speed adjustements the key measures is the standardization of the measuring height at 10m above ground based on meta data and the measurement instrument setup. Furthermore, non-climatic causes of shifts in wind speed are identified by comparing monthly means at stations to modeled monthly means.\nWith respect to the sea level and station pressure data non-climatic shifts that AHCCD data are corrected for are related to station elevation, station relocation and errors during digitization of paper records. This process scans for example for unusually high or low values, sudden extremes or physically implausible pressure changes.\nMore details on the methodology can be found in the AHCCD Technical Documentation and the references therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinks to Electricity Sector Applications\n\n\n\nFor details click on variable group to uncollapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum temperature [˚C]\nMaximum temperature [˚C]\nMean temperature [˚C]\n&gt;330 locations in Canada\n\nFor more details see the website on daily AHCCD data\n\n\n\n\nMinimum temperature [˚C]\nMaximum temperature [˚C]\nMean temperature [˚C]\n780 locations in Canada\n\nFor more details see the AHCCD Technical Documentation and the Adjusted and homogenized Canadian climate data web page for temperature data and references therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily liquid precipitation (rain) [mm/period]\nDaily solid precipitation (snow) [mm/period]\nDaily total precipitation (rain and snow) [mm/period]\n&gt;460 locations in Canada\n\nFor more details see the website on daily AHCCD data\n\n\n\n\nLiquid precipitation (rain) [mm/period]\nSolid precipitation (snow) [mm/period]\nTotal precipitation (rain and snow) [mm/period]\n467 locations in Canada\n\nFor more details see the AHCCD Technical Documentation and the Adjusted and homogenized Canadian climate data web page for precipitation data and references therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind speed [m/s]\nEvaluated at standard 10 metre level\n156 locations in Canada\n\nFor more details see the AHCCD Technical Documentation and the Adjusted and homogenized Canadian climate data web page for wind speed data and references therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStation level pressure [Pa]\nSea Level pressure [Pa]\n626 locations in Canada\n\nFor more details see the AHCCD Technical Documentation and the Adjusted and homogenized Canadian climate data web page for wind speed data and references therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily AHCCD station data can be found on ClimateData.ca or downloaded via the Climate Data Extraction Tool (Monthly, seasonal and annual AHCCD station data).

    "text": "Sources of Climate Data\nGenerally, climate data can be sourced from historical observation of climate using instrumentation or from climate model simulations. In the context of electricity system planning and design, future climatic conditions should be of primary interest, but observed historical climate data and products derived thereof may also be employed or used in the development of adequate future climate information.\nObserved data is provided as point information at station locations. To provide continuous fields of climate information, station data can be interpolated spatially to produce gridded historical data. They provide a portrait of climate beyond the stations point locations but are impacted by potential interpolation errors, particularly in data sparce regions, or in regions of complex topography (e.g. mountainous areas). The approach that attempts to overcome these drawbacks is the reproduction of historical climate through the combination of a maximum of available climate information with a physical climate simulation approach known as climate reanalysis. Reanalysis products have substantially improved over recent years and are often used as surrogates for observational data in climate science and studies.\nObservational data and reanalysis data provide a representation of the actual evolution and sequence of events as they occurred and provide robust estimates of climate when averaged over climatic periods (usually 30 years). Note, however, that due to natural climate variability, climate estimates would shift with slight temporal shifts of the period, or the data being used.\nSimulated data from climate models used for electricity system planning and design should be sourced from internationally coordinated ensembles of climate model simulations or products derived thereof. These simulations typically cover multiple decades and are available for historical and future periods. They are fully consistent in time and space and are provided on grids. The grid resolution depends on the model or the data product.\nLike observational data, bias-adjusted historical climate simulations may be used to derive climate estimates of historical climate. These estimates will not be identical to climate estimates from observed data yet will generally fall into the range of natural variability of the observed climate. Since climate model simulations extend into the future, estimates for future climate may also be derived. It is important to note that the sequence of events produced by a historical climate simulation is distinct from the sequence of historically observed events, although their respective climate estimate is the robust characteristic they have in common.",

    "text": "Summary of Types of Climate Datasets\nThe datasets discussed here can be grouped into the following categories:\n\nObservational data are direct measurements from weather stations. These provide the most accurate and high-resolution temperature records, but their coverage is often limited to specific locations, leading to gaps in certain regions, particularly oceans and remote areas. Temporal gaps in the records may also be found in station data.\nGridded observational datasets address the spatial limitation of station data by interpolating their data across a defined grid, providing more comprehensive spatial coverage. These datasets, such as those produced by national meteorological agencies, offer a balance between accuracy and spatial representation, though uncertainties arise in data-sparse regions.\nReanalysis datasets combine historical observations with climate models to create consistent, long-term reconstructions of the atmosphere. They offer global coverage and high temporal resolution, making them valuable for analyzing past climate conditions and trends. However, reanalysis products rely on model-based data assimilation, which may introduce biases, especially in areas with limited observations.\nClimate model data, often from global climate models (GCMs), simulate temperature under different greenhouse gas scenarios. These projections are essential for understanding future climate patterns and assessing potential impacts. While models provide large-scale trends, they lack the precision of observational data due to their coarse spatial resolution and inherent uncertainties in modeling processes.\n\nTogether, these datasets enable a comprehensive view of both historical and future climate conditions, supporting a wide range of applications in the electricity sector.",
