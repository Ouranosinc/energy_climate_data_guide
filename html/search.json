The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes.

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nERA5-Land is produced under a single simulation of the land component of the ERA5 climate reanalysis, without coupling to the atmospheric module of the ECMWF’s Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and without data assimilation. The low atmospheric forcing is provided by the ERA5 reanalysis, with additional lapse-rate correction. The core of ERA5-Land is the Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land incorporating land surface hydrology (H-TESSEL). Because it runs without data assimilation, it makes it computationally affordable for relatively quick updates. For example, if significant improvements of the land surface model are implemented, the whole or part of the dataset can be reprocessed in a relatively short period. Updates are possible in case improved auxiliary datasets are used as input for the production.\nProduction of ERA5-Land is not produced as a single continuous segment, but instead as three segments: Stream-1 (2001 onwards), Stream-2 (1981-2000), and Stream-3 (1950-1980). This is because it allows parallel production of data enabling sooner public access to the data, and because the atmospheric forcings used by ERA5-Land is derived from ERA5, thus needing corresponding completed ERA5 segment. Each stream is initialized with various meteorological fields from ERA5 (temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation, etc.). While ERA5-Land does not assimilate observations directly, they are introduced via the ERA5 atmospheric forcings. These forcings are adjusted using ERA5 derived lapse rates before being integrated with the ECMWF Carbon Hydrology-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CHTESSEL) land surface model. This is done in 24-hour cycles, generating hourly outputs and the evolution of the land surface state and water and energy fluxes. For further details of the assimilation system used to obtain the ERA5 atmospheric forcings, please see the ERA5 document previously prepared by the CCCS.\nUncertainty estimate: Currently, ERA5-Land variable uncertainty estimates are those corresponding to ERA5. ERA5 uncertainty estimate is sampled by a 10-member lower-resolution Ensemble Data Assimilation (EDA) which provides background-error estimates for the deterministic HRES 4D-Var Data Assimilation system. The analysis method is the same for each EDA member and follows that of the HRES. Each member (except the control) is run with different random perturbations added to the observations. Likewise, the model physical tendencies are perturbed in the short forecasts that link subsequent analysis windows. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\nThe original plan was to apply the same methodology ERA5-Land to provide an estimate of the uncertainty fields as was done for ERA5. However, the uncertainty was estimated to be extremely low, and would have assigned unrealistically high confidence to the ERA5-Land variables. As such, it is recommended to use the corresponding ERA5 uncertainty estimates for the time being until further studies are done."

    "text": "Information about the technical and scientific quality\nERA5-Land 2 m temperature represents one of the products of the latest global atmospheric reanalysis produced by Copernicus Climate Change Service at ECMWF. It is archived at a shorter (hourly) time step, has a fine spatial resolution, uses a more advanced assimilation system, and includes more sources of data than previous versions (e.g., ERA-Interim-Land). It is accompanied by extensive technical documentation and two principal scientific documentation papers. A list of ‘known issues’ is maintained at the online documentation.\nInformation on land surface model: The land surface model of the ERA5-Land was operational in 2018 with the IFS model cycle 45r1. While most of the changes from the IFS Cy41R2 used in ERA5 are primarily technical, there were a few improvements to various fields: 1) the parameterization of the soil thermal conductivity was updated to take the ice component of frozen soil into consideration, 2) conservation of the soil-water balance was fixed and improved, and 3) rain over snow is now accounted for and is not accumulated in snow pack. Furthermore, a bug exists in IFS Cy41R2, that affects potential evapotranspiration (PET) flux calculations over forests and deserts, has been corrected in ERA5-Land, and unlike ERA5, ERA5-Land PET is an available dataset. However, PET is now determined by assuming a vegetation type of crops and no soil moisture stress. These assumptions may not be always realistic, and therefore PET should be used cautiously. This is unlikely to affect ERA5-Land 2 m temperature in Canada’s north, but the user should be aware of the reason for this update. More information on the CHTESSEL land surface model used in ERA5-Land can be found in Muñoz-Sabater et al., (2021, preprint)."

However, it should be noted that in northern Canada, there are currently no sub-daily records over a long historical period for many weather stations. Reanalyses data with hourly output cover this gap and, with suitable investigation and calibration (downscaling), could be valuable particularly for hydrological models and sub-daily extremes analyses. ERA5-Land uses ERA5 atmospheric forcings that assimilates surface temperature from stations.\nAs for all gridded data, observed values of 2 m temperature at local scales can differ from the values provided by the gridded dataset, which represent a statistical summary of the area surrounding a grid point. Also, changes in the amounts and types of observational data that are assimilated may produce artificial trends or variability in 2 m temperature and other reanalysis variables."

    "text": "Sources of Climate Data Hallo\nGenerally, climate data can be sourced from historical observation of climate using instrumentation or from climate model simulations. In the context of electricity system planning and design, future climatic conditions should be of primary interest, but observed historical climate data and products derived thereof may also be employed or used in the development of adequate future climate information.\nObserved data is provided as point information at station locations. To provide continuous fields of climate information, station data can be interpolated spatially to produce gridded historical data. They provide a portrait of climate beyond the stations point locations but are impacted by potential interpolation errors, particularly in data sparce regions, or in regions of complex topography (e.g. mountainous areas). The approach that attempts to overcome these drawbacks is the reproduction of historical climate through the combination of a maximum of available climate information with a physical climate simulation approach known as climate reanalysis. Reanalysis products have substantially improved over recent years and are often used as surrogates for observational data in climate science and studies.\nObservational data and reanalysis data provide a representation of the actual evolution and sequence of events as they occurred and provide robust estimates of climate when averaged over climatic periods (usually 30 years). Note, however, that due to natural climate variability, climate estimates would shift with slight temporal shifts of the period, or the data being used.\nSimulated data from climate models used for electricity system planning and design should be sourced from internationally coordinated ensembles of climate model simulations or products derived thereof. These simulations typically cover multiple decades and are available for historical and future periods. They are fully consistent in time and space and are provided on grids. The grid resolution depends on the model or the data product.\nLike observational data, bias-adjusted historical climate simulations may be used to derive climate estimates of historical climate. These estimates will not be identical to climate estimates from observed data yet will generally fall into the range of natural variability of the observed climate. Since climate model simulations extend into the future, estimates for future climate may also be derived. It is important to note that the sequence of events produced by a historical climate simulation is distinct from the sequence of historically observed events, although their respective climate estimate is the robust characteristic they have in common.",

    "section": "Summary of Types of Climate Datasets",
    "text": "Summary of Types of Climate Datasets\nThe datasets discussed here can be grouped into the following categories:\n\nObservational data are direct measurements from weather stations. These provide the most accurate and high-resolution temperature records, but their coverage is often limited to specific locations, leading to gaps in certain regions, particularly oceans and remote areas. Temporal gaps in the records may also be found in station data.\nGridded observational datasets address the spatial limitation of station data by interpolating their data across a defined grid, providing more comprehensive spatial coverage. These datasets, such as those produced by national meteorological agencies, offer a balance between accuracy and spatial representation, though uncertainties arise in data-sparse regions.\nReanalysis datasets combine historical observations with climate models to create consistent, long-term reconstructions of the atmosphere. They offer global coverage and high temporal resolution, making them valuable for analyzing past climate conditions and trends. However, reanalysis products rely on model-based data assimilation, which may introduce biases, especially in areas with limited observations.\nClimate model data, often from global climate models (GCMs), simulate temperature under different greenhouse gas scenarios. These projections are essential for understanding future climate patterns and assessing potential impacts. While models provide large-scale trends, they lack the precision of observational data due to their coarse spatial resolution and inherent uncertainties in modeling processes.\n\nTogether, these datasets enable a comprehensive view of both historical and future climate conditions, supporting a wide range of applications in the electricity sector.",

    "text": "The Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) is a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). CaSR v3.1 is produced by dynamically downscaling ECMWF’s ERA5 global reanalysis using operational models and configurations of ECCC’s operational weather and environmental prediction system to provide historical, high-resolution climate and weather data over North America, with a focus on Canada. Surface observations are integrated through the the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) coupled with the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). CaSR is a consistent and seamless dataset providing the main meteorological variables coherent with in situ surface observations1.\n\n\n\nCaSR simulation domain with station locations (source:2)",

    "title": "Demand",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Electricity demand is a vital component in the planning, operation, and resilience of power systems. Climate change is expected to alter electricity demand patterns by affecting not only patterns of temperature, such as mean temperature, number of temperature extremes, and seasonal variations, but also consumption behaviours across different sectors. Numerous studies project increased cooling demand during hotter summers and reduced heating demand during milder winters as this pattern have been consistently observed across multiple global regions (1,2,3,4,5). The magnitude and direction of these changes are strongly dependent on the region and latitude; for example, countries in warmer climates are expected to see higher overall demand growth due to increased cooling loads (6,7,8). Climate change also affects electricity consumption by sector and temporal demand profiles, including daily and seasonal variations. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors respond differently to climate drivers (9,10,11). Meanwhile, the timing of electricity demand is shifting as well, with studies projecting changes in peak load hours and seasonal peaks due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events (1,Fonseca2019?,12).\nTo assess the impacts of climate change on electricity demand, different approaches have been employed. These include the use of climate projections from GCM and RCM combined with downscaling techniques to capture local climatic variability (13,2,Fonseca2019?,14,4). Empirical models, such as regression-bases analyses, have been also used to estimate historical relationships between temperature and electricity use (6,7,3) , while simulation tools and energy-climate models are applied to explore future scenarios under different socio-economic and climatic conditions (9,14,11).",

    "text": "Climate change drivers and affected electricity demand parameters\n\nSeasonal variations\nRising temperatures due to climate change have led to a significant in seasonal electricity demand, particularly by increasing cooling demand during summer and reducing heating needs during winter. This shifting trend has been widely documented across regional and global studies. For example,13 showed that electricity demand in the United States shows a strong nonlinear response to high temperatures, especially above 25-30 degC, driven mainly by demand for air conditioning. Similarly,15 also confirmed this global trend that there are steep increases in demand where air conditioning is rising due to climate change. Regional case studies, such asCraig2020?, have demonstrated that peak demand coincides more frequently with extreme heat days, stressing both power generation and distribution infrastructure. The anticipated rise in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves further amplifies this concerns, requiring investments in peak capacity, demand-side management, and adaptation strategies.11 projected increased summer cooling demand across European regions due to higher temperatures, while8 confirmed the similar rise in cooling demand in Cyprus.9 also found that seasonal peaks are shifting in the United States, with summer peaks becoming more dominant due to climate-induced changes in building energy use.\nHowever, while winters are projected to be warmer, the demand responses are more variable.12 introduced a classification of demand response profiles: a “V”-shaped response which is common in mid-latitude temperated cities, such as North America and Europe where demand increases at both high and low temperatures; increasing response where demand rises steadily with temperature, which can be shown in tropical cities; and unresponsive profile where minimal or no correlation between temperature and electricity demand.3 used multivariate regression in Europe to estimate electricity consumption changes and found that Northern and Central Europe will experience reduced heating demand in winter while Southern Europe will face increased cooling demand and higher costs in summer. This results in an increased annual electricity demand in Spain while it will decrease in Finland, Germany and France.5 analyzed how climate change could flatten winter peaks while enhancing summer peaks in the United Kingdom, suggesting that infrastructure planning should shift from winter-dominant to summer-dominant strategies.\n\n\nRegional variations: by continents, by latitudes\nThe impacts of climate change on electricity demand show considerable regional heterogeneity, followed by geographic location, climatic baseline, economic development, and infrastructure characteristics. A clear latitudinal pattern exists: countries at lower latitude are projected to have higher increases in electricity demand for cooling, while higher latitude regions may observe mixed outcomes due to the opposing effects of warmer winters and hotter summers.\nIn tropical regions, where average temperature are already high, even modest increases in temperature can trigger substantial rises in electricity use.6 found that rising temperatures will affect electricity demand for all warming levels due to increasing air conditioning needs, with low adaptive capacity exacerbating system stress in Niger.7\n\n\nDemand parameters\n\nAnnual demand: generation capacity and/or storage capacity\nSize and timing of peak demand: maintenance and construction schedule, supply planning\nSpatial distribution of demand: topology and capacity of the electricity transmission networks.\nSectors: ability to adapt or respond to climate change",

    "text": "Electricity demand is a vital component in the planning, operation, and resilience of power systems. Climate change is expected to alter electricity demand patterns by affecting not only patterns of temperature, such as mean temperature, number of temperature extremes, and seasonal variations, but also consumption behaviours across different sectors. Numerous studies project increased cooling demand during hotter summers and reduced heating demand during milder winters as this pattern have been consistently observed across multiple global regions (Amonkar et al. (2023), Auffhammer and Aroonruengsawat (2011), Pilli-Sihvola et al. (2010), Trotter et al. (2016), Wood et al. (2015)). The magnitude and direction of these changes are strongly dependent on the region and latitude; for example, countries in warmer climates are expected to see higher overall demand growth due to increased cooling loads (Bonkaney et al. (2023), Emodi et al. (2018), Zachariadis and Hadjinicolaou (2014)). Climate change also affects electricity consumption by sector and temporal demand profiles, including daily and seasonal variations. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors respond differently to climate drivers (Dirks et al. (2015), Shaik (2024), Taseska et al. (2012)). Meanwhile, the timing of electricity demand is shifting as well, with studies projecting changes in peak load hours and seasonal peaks due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events (Amonkar et al.

    "text": "Sources of Climate Data\nGenerally, climate data can be sourced from historical observation of climate using instrumentation or from climate model simulations. In the context of electricity system planning and design, future climatic conditions should be of primary interest, but observed historical climate data and products derived thereof may also be employed or used in the development of adequate future climate information.\nObserved data is provided as point information at station locations. To provide continuous fields of climate information, station data can be interpolated spatially to produce gridded historical data. They provide a portrait of climate beyond the stations point locations but are impacted by potential interpolation errors, particularly in data sparce regions, or in regions of complex topography (e.g. mountainous areas). The approach that attempts to overcome these drawbacks is the reproduction of historical climate through the combination of a maximum of available climate information with a physical climate simulation approach known as climate reanalysis. Reanalysis products have substantially improved over recent years and are often used as surrogates for observational data in climate science and studies.\nObservational data and reanalysis data provide a representation of the actual evolution and sequence of events as they occurred and provide robust estimates of climate when averaged over climatic periods (usually 30 years). Note, however, that due to natural climate variability, climate estimates would shift with slight temporal shifts of the period, or the data being used.\nSimulated data from climate models used for electricity system planning and design should be sourced from internationally coordinated ensembles of climate model simulations or products derived thereof. These simulations typically cover multiple decades and are available for historical and future periods. They are fully consistent in time and space and are provided on grids. The grid resolution depends on the model or the data product.\nLike observational data, bias-adjusted historical climate simulations may be used to derive climate estimates of historical climate. These estimates will not be identical to climate estimates from observed data yet will generally fall into the range of natural variability of the observed climate. Since climate model simulations extend into the future, estimates for future climate may also be derived. It is important to note that the sequence of events produced by a historical climate simulation is distinct from the sequence of historically observed events, although their respective climate estimate is the robust characteristic they have in common.",

    "section": "Summary of Types of Climate Datasets",
    "text": "Summary of Types of Climate Datasets\nThe datasets discussed here can be grouped into the following categories:\n\nObservational data are direct measurements from weather stations. These provide the most accurate and high-resolution temperature records, but their coverage is often limited to specific locations, leading to gaps in certain regions, particularly oceans and remote areas. Temporal gaps in the records may also be found in station data.\nGridded observational datasets address the spatial limitation of station data by interpolating their data across a defined grid, providing more comprehensive spatial coverage. These datasets, such as those produced by national meteorological agencies, offer a balance between accuracy and spatial representation, though uncertainties arise in data-sparse regions.\nReanalysis datasets combine historical observations with climate models to create consistent, long-term reconstructions of the atmosphere. They offer global coverage and high temporal resolution, making them valuable for analyzing past climate conditions and trends. However, reanalysis products rely on model-based data assimilation, which may introduce biases, especially in areas with limited observations.\nClimate model data, often from global climate models (GCMs), simulate temperature under different greenhouse gas scenarios. These projections are essential for understanding future climate patterns and assessing potential impacts. While models provide large-scale trends, they lack the precision of observational data due to their coarse spatial resolution and inherent uncertainties in modeling processes.\n\nTogether, these datasets enable a comprehensive view of both historical and future climate conditions, supporting a wide range of applications in the electricity sector.",

Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecastsinstitute_id :ECMWFdataset_id :ERA5-Landabstract :ERA5-Land provides hourly high resolution information of surface variables. The data is a replay of the land component of the ERA5 climate reanalysis with a finer spatial resolution: ~9km grid spacing. ERA5-Land includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions. The model used in the production of ERA5-Land is the tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land incorporating land surface hydrology (H-TESSEL).dataset_description :https://www.ecmwf.int/en/era5-landlicense_type :permissivelicense :Please acknowledge the use of ERA5-Land as stated in the Copernicus C3S/CAMS License agreement http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/copernicus/attribution :Contains modified Copernicus Climate Change Service Information 2022.
