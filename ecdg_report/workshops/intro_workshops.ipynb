    "To develop this online guidance on the use of climate data in the energy sector, a series of workshops were conducted with Canadian energy organizations. These workshops aimed to gain deeper insight into how climate information is applied in real-world decision-making. The insights gathered are integrated throughout the guidance, with illustrative examples of applications provided across various [energy sectors](../sectors/electricity_sector_activities.ipynb)."

    " - Identify missing information (ex: climate variables or tools) in the decision-making process that relies on climate information\n",
    " - Funnel approach: starting with describing a decision-making challenge and moving toward more technical (ex: temporal and spatial scales of the datasets used)"
