    "# Canadian Surface Reanalysis - CaSR\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) is a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). CaSR v3.1 is produced by dynamically downscaling [ECMWF's ERA5 global reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels) using operational models and configurations of ECCC's operational weather and environmental prediction system to provide historical, high-resolution climate and weather data over North America, with a focus on Canada. Surface observations of tempererature, humidity, snow depth and precipitation are integrated through the the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) coupled with the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). CaSR is a consistent and seamless dataset providing the main meteorological variables coherent with in situ surface observations @Gasset2021. Note that the CaSR dataset was previously known as RDRS (Regional Deterministic Reforecast System).\n",

    "The Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) dataset provides high-resolution, gridded climate data with seamless coverage across North America. CaSR has one of the highest spatial resolutions of gridded observational datasets over Canada and North America and it distinguishes itself from other reanalysis products through the assimilation of precipitation observations through the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). It is therefore coherent with in situ observations of precipitation, absolute and dew point temperature and snow depth. The model used in the production includes a representation of lakes, which influence local climate. This feature is visible particularly in the shoulder season temperature fields and influences the thermal surface properties. The CaPA system used to produce the gridded precipitation fields includes strict quality control procedures to avoid the assimilation of biased observations. This includes using wind speed to determine validity of solid precipitation measurements depending on the gauge type and weather station characteristics. Due to the complexity of the prodedure and difficulties with quality control radar data are currently not assimilated. Overall, CaSR was conceptualized for hydrological applications, where high-resolution precipitation and land-surface variables are critical. @Gasset2021\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature biases in CaSR exhibit an annual cycle with larger errors in winter and spring and smaller errors in summer and autumn. When compared to the NRCanMET gridded observations, CaSR shows slightly warmer mean minimum temperatures and slightly colder mean maximum temperatures. As a result, the daily temperature range in CaSR is narrower than in NRCanMET. Air temperature biases are clearly correlated to elevation differences between nearby stations and the corresponding grid elevation. With improvement in the latest version of CaSR spring temperatures are higher and less biased in version 3.1 than in version 2.1. Pixels near water or mixed water/land pixels tend to exhibit a stronger cold bias. Overall, the magnitude of the biases varies by temperature variable and region, emphasizing the need for validation of the dataset at a particular location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precipitation in CaSR is generally positively biased, and this bias tends to increase with distance from the assimilated in-situ stations. The dataset is wetter than ERA5-Land, which itself is part of a broader tendency of reanalyses to be too wet. Mountain precipitation is better resolved in CaSR than in ERA5-Land or NRCanMET, owing to its higher spatial resolution. Due to the offline precipitation analysis inconsistencies can arise with other modeled fields such as radiation and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study over British Columbia watersheds, confirms CaSR'S persistent cold bias alongside a wet bias. CaSR version 2.1 also shows drying trends in BC watersheds. The dataset proves skillful in capturing spatial mountain patterns and temporal trends. @Goswami2024\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 3.1 of CaSR represents a major improvement over version 2.1. It shows better agreement with surface observations across all variables, seasons, and domains. Precipitation performance is similar or slightly improved, and the version includes the additional benefit of a new precipitation partitioning into rainfall and snowfall. Version 3.1 also assimilates up to 1,000 more observations per analysis, particularly improving winter performance in Canada. @Gasset2025\n",
