    "# Canadian Surface Reanalysis - CaSR\n",
    "(was: Regional Deterministic Reforecast System - RDRS v2.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) is a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It provides historical, high-resolution climate and weather data over North America, with a focus on Canada. CaSR is based on the Global Deterministic Reanalysis (CGRD) but refined with the Canadian Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) to better capture local climate variations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Strengths of CaSR\n",
    "**High Resolution:** ~10 km grid spacing provides detailed spatial variability, better than global reanalyses.  \n",
    "**Assimilation of Diverse Observations:** Uses satellite, surface, and upper-air data for accuracy.  \n",
    "**Hourly Data Availability:** Useful for high-frequency climate and weather analysis.  \n",
    "**Canadian-Specific Calibration:** Optimized for Canadian climate conditions, including extreme cold and snow processes.  \n",
    "**Consistent Historical Record:** Spans over four decades, allowing for trend analysis and climate studies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Limitations of CaSR\n",
    "**Limited Coverage:** Primarily focused on Canada, with partial U.S. coverage.  \n",
    "**Model Biases:** Errors may exist due to model physics and parameterizations, especially in complex terrain (e.g., mountains).  \n",
    "**Precipitation Uncertainties:** Like all reanalyses, CaSR precipitation estimates may deviate from observed values in localized regions.  \n",
    "**Limited to Land surface:** Primarily land-focused, no information over oceans is available.  \n",
    "**Computationally Intensive:** Relatively high-resolution data requires significant storage and processing power for analysis over larger areas.\n",
