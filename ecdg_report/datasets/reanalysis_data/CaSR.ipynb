    "# Canadian Surface Reanalysis - CaSR\n",
    "(previously: Regional Deterministic Reforecast System - RDRS v2.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) is a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It provides historical, high-resolution climate and weather data over North America, with a focus on Canada. CaSR is based on the Global Deterministic Reforecast System (GDRS) and refined with the Canadian Regional Reforecast System (RDRS) to better capture local variations.\n",

    "## Strengths and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "[**ToDo:** Upcoming discussion with Nicolas Gasset, include known more issues & strengths with CaSR]{.mark-red}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Strengths of CaSR\n",
    "**High Resolution:** ~10 km grid spacing provides detailed spatial variability, better than global reanalyses.  \n",
    "**Assimilation of Diverse Observations:** Uses satellite, surface, and upper-air data for accuracy.  \n",
    "**Hourly Data Availability:** Useful for high-frequency climate and weather analysis.  \n",
    "**Canadian-Specific:** Optimized for Canadian climate conditions, including extreme cold and snow processes.  \n",
    "**Convidence Index:** A confidence index for precipitation informs on the weight of observations in the analysis.  \n",
    "**Detailed Precipitation:** Precipitation types are distiguished (ice pellets, freezing precipitation, liquid water equivalent of snow, liquid precipitation) and modeled as well as reanalysis precipitation are provided.  \n",
    "**Active Development:** New versions and longer temporal record in preparation.  \n",
    "~~**Consistent Historical Record:** Spans over four decades, allowing for trend analysis and climate studies.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Limitations of CaSR\n",
    "~~**Limited Coverage:** Primarily focused on Canada, with partial U.S. coverage.~~  \n",
    "**Model Biases:** Errors may exist due to model physics and parameterizations, especially in complex terrain (e.g., mountains).  \n",
    "**Limited Suitability for Trend Analysis:** For the current version, gaps in observation data and model errors may skew trends found in the dataset. [**ToDo:** Check with Nicolas, Hélène/Marilyn's results]{.mark-red}.  \n",
    "**Uncommon Georeference:** The data are made available on a rotated grid which may be difficult to handle.  \n",
    "**Precipitation Uncertainties:** Like all reanalyses, CaSR precipitation estimates may deviate from observed values in localized regions.  \n",
    "**Limited to Land surface:** Primarily land-focused, no information over oceans is available.  \n",
    "**Computationally Intensive:** Relatively high-resolution data requires significant storage and processing power for analysis over larger areas.  \n",
