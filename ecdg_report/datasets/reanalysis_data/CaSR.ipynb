    "# Canadian Surface Reanalysis - CaSR\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR) is a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). CaSR v3.1 is produced by dynamically downscaling [ECMWF's ERA5 global reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels) using operational models and configurations of ECCC's operational weather and environmental prediction system to provide historical, high-resolution climate and weather data over North America, with a focus on Canada. Surface observations are integrated through the the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) coupled with the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). CaSR is a consistent and seamless dataset providing the main meteorological variables coherent with in situ surface observations @Gasset2021. Note that the CaSR dataset was previously known as RDRS (Regional Deterministic Reforecast System).\n",
