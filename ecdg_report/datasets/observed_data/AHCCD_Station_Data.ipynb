    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) are climate station datasets of quality-controlled and homogenized historical climate data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It provides long-term station-based observations for temperature and precipitation across Canada. The datasets incorporate adjustments to the historical station data for non-climatic factors (e.g., station relocations, site exposure, instrumentation changes, observer, observing procedures) to ensure consistency and reliability for climate trend analysis. \n",

    "- **Temporal resolution:** Annual, seasonal, monthly and daily values\n",
    "- **Spatial coverage:** Stations across all Canadian provinces and territories  \n",
    "- **Spatial resolution:** Point locations across Canada  \n",

    "|Strength|Description|\n",
    "|-|---|\n",
    "|**Homogenized Time Series**    |Adjustments remove artificial shifts due to non-climatic influences, enabling accurate trend analysis.|  \n",
    "|**Long-Term Coverage**.        |Many stations provide over 100 years of data for studying climate variability and change.|  \n",
    "|**National Consistency**       |Standardized methodologies applied across the Canadian network.|  \n",

    "|Limitation|Description|\n",
    "|-|---|\n",
    "|**Station Coverage Gaps**              |Sparse in some northern or remote regions, limiting spatial completeness.|  \n",
    "|**Limited Variables**                  |Focused mainly on temperature and precipitation; does not include wind, humidity, etc.|  \n",
    "|**Historical Instrumentation Issues** |Despite adjustments, some uncertainties remain from early observational practices.|  \n",
    "|**Point Locations**                  |Station-based data may not represent broader regional conditions, particularly in more northern station sparse areas where the next station my be far away and in complex terrain where local conditions change over short distances.|  \n",
    "|**Limited temporal coverage**        |The lenght of the data records vary by station. There may be gaps in the stations data or a station may have been retired. While the dataset is updated annually, the latest observation data may not have been processed.|\n",
