    "# Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) dataset is a collection of quality-controlled and homogenized historical climate data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It provides long-term station-based observations for temperature and precipitation across Canada. The dataset corrects for non-climatic changes (e.g., station relocations, instrument changes) to ensure consistency and reliability in climate trend analysis.\n",

    "## Key Strengths of AHCCD\n",
    "- **Homogenized Time Series:** Adjustments remove artificial shifts due to non-climatic influences, enabling accurate trend analysis.  \n",
    "- **Long-Term Coverage:** Many stations provide over 100 years of data for studying climate variability and change.  \n",
    "- **National Consistency:** Standardized methodologies applied across the Canadian network.  \n",
    "- **Open Access**: Freely available for public, academic, and government use.  \n",
    "- **Supports Climate Indicators:** Used in the development of Canadian climate change indicators and official climate assessments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of AHCCD\n",
    "- **Station Coverage Gaps:** Sparse in some northern or remote regions, limiting spatial completeness.  \n",
    "- **Limited Variables:** Focused mainly on temperature and precipitation; does not include wind, humidity, etc.  \n",
    "- **Historical Instrumentation Issues:** Despite adjustments, some uncertainties remain from early observational practices.  \n",
    "- **Fixed Locations:** Station-based data may not represent broader regional conditions in complex terrain.  \n",
    "- **Limited temporal coverage:** The latest observation data may not have been processed. Daily data availability has not seen a recent update.\n",
