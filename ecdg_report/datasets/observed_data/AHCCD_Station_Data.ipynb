    "\n",
    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) dataset is a collection of quality-controlled and homogenized historical climate data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It provides long-term station-based observations for temperature and precipitation across Canada. The dataset corrects for non-climatic changes (e.g., station relocations, instrument changes) to ensure consistency and reliability in climate trend analysis.\n",
