    "## Summary Description\n",
    "The Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) are climate station datasets of quality-controlled and homogenized historical climate data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It provides long-term station-based observations for temperature, precipitation, wind and atmospheric pressure across Canada. The datasets incorporate adjustments to the historical station data for non-climatic factors (e.g., station relocations, site exposure, instrumentation changes, observer, observing procedures) to ensure consistency and reliability. AHCCD data was developed for climate research, climate change studies and trend analysis. \n",

    "Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) produces the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) for use in climate research and climate change studies and have been used in the production of climate trends @Vincent2015 ^,^ @Vincent2018b. The data are collected from Reference Climate Stations and some Canadian Aviation Weather Service stations. They are different from the official Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) in situ records and should not be used for legal purposes. The AHCCD station IDs are the same as those of the MSC stations to facilitate comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are point data and may not represent the climate values for a larger region. Althought the time series are quality controlled there may be missing values in the data, varying by variable station and time (see figure above).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances AHCCD data from nearby stations may be merged to create a longer record. The length of the records for individual stations may vary significantly, and some records are from stations that have been closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-climatic shifts in tempertature data are identified by statistically comparing adjacent stations. Station metadata are investigated to understand non-climatic causes and determine a corrective measure if a shift has been identified. A recurring adjustment is related to the change in observing time at principal stations in 1961. The correction of the temperature record results in a slightly stronger warming in the homogenized dataset than the unadjusted data: For southern Canada this trend changed from 1.32° to 1.62°C for 1900–2018, with a smaller change for all of Canada. @Vincent2020\n",
    "\n",
    "Precipitation data correction accounts for a number of known errors in precipitation measurements, such as underestimation of actually gauged precipitation and limits to the minimum measurable amount. Snow measurements adjust for varying snow density depending on geographical location. Updates of historical adjusted precipitation has been interrupted since Autumn 2017. This hiatus is related to the integration of manual observations to an increasingly automated station network. Updates are planned to be resumed, but no time has been specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For wind speed adjustements the key measures is the standardization of the measuring height at 10m above ground based on meta data and the measurement instrument setup. Furthermore, non-climatic causes of shifts in wind speed are identified by comparing monthly means at stations to modeled monthly means.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the sea level and station pressure data non-climatic shifts that AHCCD data are corrected for are related to station elevation, station relocation and errors during digitization of paper records. This process scans for example for unusually high or low values, sudden extremes or physically implausible pressure changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the methodology can be found in the [AHCCD Technical Documentation](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/display-download/technical-documentation-adjusted-climate-data.html) and the references therein.\n",
