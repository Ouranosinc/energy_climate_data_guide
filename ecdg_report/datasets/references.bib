    abstract={We describe a spatially contiguous, temporally consistent high-resolution gridded daily meteorological dataset for northwestern North America. This{\thinspace}>4 million km2 region has high topographic relief, seasonal snowpack, permafrost and glaciers, crosses multiple jurisdictional boundaries and contains the entire Yukon, Mackenzie, Saskatchewan, Fraser and Columbia drainages. We interpolate daily station data to 1/16{\textdegree} spatial resolution using a high-resolution monthly 1971--2000 climatology as a predictor in a thin-plate spline interpolating algorithm. Only temporally consistent climate stations with at least 40 years of record are included. Our approach is designed to produce a dataset well suited for driving hydrological models and training statistical downscaling schemes. We compare our results to two commonly used datasets and show improved performance for climate means, extremes and variability. When used to drive a hydrologic model, our dataset also outperforms these datasets for runoff ratios and streamflow trends in several, high elevation, sub-basins of the Fraser River.},

    abstract = { A second generation adjusted precipitation daily dataset has been prepared for trend analysis in Canada. Daily rainfall and snowfall amounts have been adjusted for 464 stations for known measurement issues such as wind undercatch, evaporation and wetting losses for each type of rain-gauge, snow water equivalent from ruler measurements, trace observations and accumulated amounts from several days. Observations from nearby stations were sometimes combined to create time series that are longer; hence, making them more useful for trend studies. In this new version, daily adjustments are an improvement over the previous version because they are derived from an extended dataset and enhanced metadata knowledge. Datasets were updated to cover recent years, including 2009. The impact of the adjustments on rainfall and snowfall total amounts and trends was examined in detail. As a result of adjustments, total rainfall amounts have increased by 5 to 10\% in southern Canada and by more than 20\% in the Canadian Arctic, compared to the original observations, while the effect of the adjustments on snowfall were larger and more variable throughout the country. The slope of the rain trend lines decreased as a result of the larger correction applied to the older rain-gauges while the slope of the snow trend lines increased, mainly along the west coast and in the Arctic. Finally, annual and seasonal rainfall and snowfall trends based on the adjusted series were computed for 1950–2009 and 1900–2009. Overall, rainfall has increased across the country while a mix of non-significant increasing and decreasing trends was found during the summer in the Canadian Prairies. Snowfall has increased mainly in the north while a significant decrease was observed in the southwestern part of the country for 1950–2009.}

    abstract = { This study presents the development of a new dataset of homogenized temperature for use in trend analysis and monitoring climate change in Canada. This dataset contains daily data for 780 locations across the country: 508 locations with an active station (current observations) and long record (starting prior to 1990); 53 locations with an active station and short record (starting after 1990); and 219 locations with no current observations (station closed) but with more than 30 years of data. Daily observations from nearby sites were often merged into a single record to create a long time series. This new dataset includes observations taken at Reference Climate Stations and from the Canada Aviation Weather Services, which are used to extend past climate observations into recent times. First, the data were quality controlled. The daily minimum temperature was adjusted for the change in observing time at principal stations in 1961. Parallel daily data were used to detect non-climatic shifts when the observations from nearby sites were merged. Series of annual and seasonal mean temperatures were tested for homogeneity. Daily temperatures were adjusted using a quantile-matching procedure if needed. Two main causes of data inhomogeneity affecting the trends over the 1948–2018 and 1900–2018 periods were identified. First, the change in observing time in 1961 introduced a cold bias in the annual means of the daily minimum temperatures after 1961. Second, merging observations from airport stations with older records has often created an artificial decreasing shift in the unadjusted data because of the better exposure of the instruments at airport stations. This new homogenized dataset shows a slightly stronger warming than the unadjusted data: the trend in the annual mean temperature for Canada has changed from 1.69° to 1.74°C for 1948–2018, and the trend for southern Canada has changed from 1.32° to 1.62°C for 1900–2018 because of all the adjustments applied to daily temperature in this study. }
