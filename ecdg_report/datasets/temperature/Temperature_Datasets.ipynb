    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature datasets are crucial for understanding climate variability and change. These datasets come from a variety of sources, each offering unique strengths depending on the type of analysis required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observational data** are direct temperature measurements from weather stations, buoys, and satellites. These provide the most accurate and high-resolution temperature records, but their coverage is often limited to specific locations, leading to gaps in certain regions, particularly oceans and remote areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gridded observational datasets** address this limitation by interpolating station data across a defined grid, providing more comprehensive spatial coverage. These datasets, such as those produced by national meteorological agencies, offer a balance between accuracy and spatial representation, though uncertainties arise in data-sparse regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reanalysis datasets** combine historical observations with climate models to create consistent, long-term reconstructions of the atmosphere. They offer global coverage and high temporal resolution, making them valuable for analyzing past climate conditions and trends. However, reanalysis products rely on model-based data assimilation, which may introduce biases, especially in areas with limited observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Climate model data**, often from global climate models (GCMs), simulate temperature under different greenhouse gas scenarios. These projections are essential for understanding future climate patterns and assessing potential impacts. While models provide large-scale temperature trends, they lack the precision of observational data due to their coarse spatial resolution and inherent uncertainties in modeling processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these temperature datasets enable a comprehensive view of both historical and future climate conditions, supporting a wide range of climate research and impact assessments."
