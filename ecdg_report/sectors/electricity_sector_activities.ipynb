    "[_Do we separate out these asset types? We could have a separate “chapter” on hydro, T&D, etc. However, all generating stations have transformers as does T&D, so we could talk once about extreme temperature as a design value and how it interacts with each of these types of stations. The same is true of extreme flooding. We could repeat sections for each asset type or talk about how it affects each asset. Because the project is focused on climate data, I am leaning towards being able to do a deeper literature review on climate extremes and then relate that back to design values.
