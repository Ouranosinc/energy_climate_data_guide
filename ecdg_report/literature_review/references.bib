abstract = {The integration of indigenous knowledge with scientific knowledge has emerged as a key area of interest in various disciplines, including environmental management, agriculture, healthcare, and education. Indigenous knowledge, developed over centuries by Indigenous peoples and local communities, reflects a deep-rooted understanding of local ecosystems, sustainable practices, and holistic approaches to health and development. Meanwhile, scientific knowledge, often seen as more universal and formalized, contributes empirical methodologies and technological advancements. This systematic review explores the importance, challenges, and benefits of integrating these two knowledge systems. By reviewing relevant literature, this paper identifies pathways for successful integration, highlighting case studies from environmental conservation, agriculture, and healthcare that demonstrate the complementary strengths of indigenous and scientific knowledge. The paper concludes that integrating scientific and indigenous knowledge holds great promise for addressing global challenges. Despite obstacles like power disparities and differing epistemologies, effective integration can lead to a comprehensive and lasting solution that promotes equitable collaborations, protects intellectual property, and creates culturally appropriate frameworks. Collaborative research that treats indigenous populations as equal partners ensures innovations are both scientifically and culturally valid. Successful integration therefore requires frameworks sensitive to cultural differences and the social and spiritual aspects of indigenous knowledge, supported by legal and policy measures to safeguard and benefit from indigenous knowledge.},

The consequences of increasing global temperature on the operating cost of existing buildings, and the associated health, safety, and economic risks were investigated. Eight cities in Ontario, Canada, across climate zones 5 to 8, were selected for this study. Statistical models were employed to forecast daily temperatures for 50 years. The impact of climate change on buildings' heating and cooling demands for energy was measured as changes in heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) compared to current design requirements. The results predict an increase in the demand for cooling and a decrease in that for heating within the next 50 years. A drop in the total HDD and CDD is shown which reflects a more comfortable outdoor thermal condition. Risk to human health attributable to the increase in global temperature is negligible.},

abstract = {{This study focuses on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) electricity market in Texas and demonstrates how the increase in temperature due to climate change is already driving large increases in electricity demand and total electricity costs. Results show that, compared to a 1950–80 baseline climate, electricity demand in 2023 was 1.9 GW (3.9%) higher because of the extreme temperatures of that year}climate change contributed 47% of this increase, with the rest coming from short-term climate variability. As demand increases, so does the price per unit of electricity, so consumers are hit double: They must buy more electricity, and each unit of electricity costs more. Using data from the wholesale market, we estimate that the total cost of electricity (the combination of higher demand and higher per unit prices) increased by $7.6B in 2023 compared to the baseline climate, $290 per ERCOT customer, with most of this increase occurring during the summer. Climate change contributed about 29% of this ($2.2B, $83 per customer), while short-term variability contributed the rest. About two-thirds of this increase is due to price increases triggered when the ERCOT grid becomes constrained. Investments in increasing the power supply or the ability to transmit it across the state, or reducing demand (e.g., demand response), could substantially reduce the impact of increasing temperature on the cost of electricity in Texas.},

abstract = {Canadian energy demand has been increasing due to population, industrial, and economic growth, and the effects of climate change have gained more visibility. Energy use is a major contributor for anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, global scale energy management strategies are paramount in climate change mitigation. However, the complicated ‘marriage' between the climate change, energy demand and consumption, and the policy instruments are not sufficiently investigated. Therefore, this paper attempts to study the effect of policy instruments on energy demand and to identify other causes behind the demand trends. A comprehensive review of governmental policies assesses the consistency and effectiveness of existing policy instruments. Communication models for participatory involvement of stakeholders in mitigation initiatives as well as the financial benefits and offsets are critically evaluated. The findings indicate that often, the views of some stakeholder groups, including the individual households and citizens, are not successfully reflected in policies. There is an apparent gap between the regulatory instruments and policies of the territorial, provincial, and local governments. Most stakeholders possess limited knowledge due to missing or partial information about energy demand and the outcomes of various policies. This paper aims to trigger a scholarly discussion focusing on the dynamics of energy demand and reguatory instruments and policies for climate change mitigation.},

abstract = {In recent years, the building sector has received increasing attention with attempts to limit its energy consumptions and GHG emissions. In fact, buildings account for more than 30% of the overall energy demand worldwide, with projections for increases in this quota due to climate changes, urbanization, and higher living comfort standards. This study investigates the effects of climate changes on the heating and cooling energy demand of buildings in the most populated urban region in Canada, i.e. the city of Toronto in Ontario. Statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are utilized to generate several future weather files, starting from different baseline climates including the old Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculation CWEC (representing the 1959–1989 period) and the new CWEC 2016 (representing the 1998–2014 period). In dynamical downscaling, a regional climate model is used to obtain a finer resolution than traditional general circulation models. The generated future weather data sets are then used for simulating the energy demand of 16 building prototypes. The simulation results show an average decrease of 18%–33% for the heating energy use intensity, and an average increase of 15%–126% for the cooling energy use intensity by 2070, depending on the baseline climatic file of use and building typology. The forecasted GHG emissions of each building prototype are then discussed. The results demonstrate the need to perform building modelling with sensitivity analysis of future climate scenarios in order to design more resilient buildings.},

abstract = {Climate change might impact various components of the bulk electric power system, including electricity demand; transmission; and thermal, hydropower, wind, and solar generators. Most research in this area quantifies impacts on one or a few components and does not link these impacts to effects on power system planning and operations. Here, we advance the understanding of how climate change might impact the bulk U.S. power system in three ways. First, we synthesize recent research to capture likely component-level impacts of climate change in the United States. Second, given the interconnected nature of the electric power system, we assess how aggregated component-level impacts might affect power system planning and operations. Third, we outline an agenda for future research on climate change impacts on power system planning and operations. Although component-level impacts vary in their magnitude, collectively they might significantly affect planning and operations. Most notably, increased demand plus reduced firm capacity across generation types might require systems to procure significant additional capacity to maintain planning reserve margins, and regional declines in renewable resources might need to be offset by increasing zero-carbon investment to meet decarbonization targets. Aggregated impacts might also affect operations, e.g., through shifts in dispatching and increased operational reserve requirements. Future research should aggregate component-level impacts at operational timescales, quantify impacts on wind and solar variability, and contextualize climate change impacts within ongoing shifts in the electric power system.},

Yet fewer studies have explored the physical impacts of climate change on the power sector. The present analysis examines how projected rising temperatures affect the demand for and supply of electricity. We apply a common set of temperature projections to three well-known electric sector models in the United States: the US version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-USA), the Regional Electricity Deployment System model (ReEDS), and the Integrated Planning Model (IPM{\textregistered}). Incorporating the effects of rising temperatures from a control scenario without emission mitigation into the models raises electricity demand by 1.6 to 6.5 % in 2050 with similar changes in emissions. The increase in system costs in the reference scenario to meet this additional demand is comparable to the change in system costs associated with decreasing power sector emissions by approximately 50 % in 2050. This result underscores the importance of adequately incorporating the effects of long-run temperature change in climate policy analysis.},

For this purpose, assuming the currently observed electricity demand–temperature relationship holds in the future, we have generated daily time series of pseudo-electricity demand for the recent past and the twenty-first century by using simulated temperatures from statistical downscaling of global climate model experiments. We show that both the frequency and severity of extreme electricity demand days at the national level are expected to increase, even for low levels of regional warming. Moreover, the occurrence of these extremes will experience a seasonal shift from winter to summer due to the projected temperature increases in both seasons. Under a RCP8.5 scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, the extended summer season (June–September) will concentrate more than 50% of extreme electricity demand days by the mid-century, increasing to 90% before the end of the century. These changes in electricity demand have considerable spatial heterogeneity over the country, with northwestern Spain experiencing the seasonal shift later than the rest of the country, due to the relatively mild summer temperatures and lower projected warming there.},

abstract = {Assessing the impacts of future climate change on electricity demand is critical to managing electricity systems efficiently and identifying reliable adaptation measures to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. This study assessed the impacts of future climate change on electricity demand while considering simultaneous interactions among multiple factors and the expected diurnal and seasonal variations of meteorological conditions. The study targeted regions across the wide climate zones of Japan and the period from 2020 to 2080. Models were developed using multiple meteorological and human behavioral indicators to explain the hourly demand for electricity. Multivariate adaptive regression splines were used for model construction to capture the simultaneous interaction effects of multiple meteorological variables. Hourly future climate scenarios were then generated based on the daily scenarios that were developed with four global climate models for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 2.6. These scenarios were applied to the models of electricity demand to project future electricity demand at an hourly temporal resolution. The regional and temporal variations of the impacts of future climate change on electricity consumption were illustrated by examining the projected hourly electricity demand for ten regions in Japan. Nationwide total annual impacts on consumption were not large. Consumption was projected to increase by approximately 1.8% (0.3–3.0%) from 2020 to 2080 in Japan for RCP8.5. However, the increases of nationwide consumption during the hot seasons were significant, as much as 14.2% (10.7–18.0%). Less frequent but high-intensity spikes of demand were projected to increase in frequency and intensity during the summer as the years progressed from 2020 to 2080. The net impact was determined by the balance between the increase of electricity demand for cooling and the decrease of electricity demand for heating. The contrast between the increased demand for cooling and decreased demand for heating increased as the years progressed. In addition to the progressively larger magnitude of the impacts, climate change was predicted to gradually enlarge regions of greater consumption for electricity, the duration of the seasons of greater demand, and the hours per day when cooling was required. The impacts based on RCP8.5 could be reduced if the RCP2.6 scenario were followed.},

abstract = {Electricity demand is a crucial factor in energy system planning. Understanding future electricity demand is vital for developing effective energy and climate policies, as well as establishing a resilient and sustainable energy system. In light of these considerations, the escalating challenges posed by climate change are anticipated to have a substantial impact on electricity demand. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive analysis delving into the dynamic nature of Temperature Response Functions (TRFs) of electricity demand across Europe. By examining various factors influencing electricity demand in residential buildings, such as thermal insulation, heating electrification, space cooling, and passive cooling, we aim to understand their collective impact on shaping future Temperature Response Functions. To project electricity demand, our study incorporates these factors into our scenario assumptions. Through a comprehensive investigation of these scenarios, our findings reveal distinctive regional influences of these factors. In regions where heating demand prevails, an initial increase in electricity demand is anticipated due to increased electrification rates. However, improved building thermal insulation is expected to substantially reduce winter electricity demand in the long run. Conversely, in regions with pronounced cooling demand, a notable escalation in electricity demand is foreseen due to increased space cooling penetration rate. Nevertheless, the application of effective passive cooling measurements is expected to mitigate and markedly diminish this increase. By highlighting the differential influences of these factors on electricity demand across Europe, our findings can offer valuable insights and guidelines first for energy system modelers for considering the change in Temperature Response Functions and second for policymakers to develop effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.},

Globally, changes in climate circa 2050 have a moderate impact on energy consumption of 7–17%, depending on the degree of warming. Impacts vary in sign and magnitude across regions, fuels, and sectors. Climatically-induced changes in energy use are larger in tropical regions. Almost all continents experience increases in energy demand, driven by the commercial and industrial sectors. In Europe declines in energy use by residences drive an overall reduction in aggregate final energy. Energy use increases in almost all G20 economies located in the tropics, while outside of Europe G20 countries in temperate regions experience both increasing and declining total energy use, depending on the incidence of changes in the frequency of hot and cold days.

abstract = {The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) manages the electric power across most of Texas. They make short-term assessments of electricity demand on the basis of historical weather over the last two decades, thereby ignoring the effects of climate change and the possibility of weather variability outside the recent historical range. In this paper, we develop an empirical method to predict the impact of weather on energy demand. We use that with a large ensemble of climate model runs to construct a probability distribution of power demand on the ERCOT grid for summer and winter 2021. We find that the most severe weather events will use 100% of available power-if anything goes wrong, as it did during the 2021 winter, there will not be sufficient available power. More quantitatively, we estimate a 5% chance that maximum power demand would be within 4.3 and 7.9 GW of ERCOT's estimate of best-case available resources during summer and winter 2021, respectively, and a 20% chance it would be within 7.1 and 17 GW. The shortage of power on the ERCOT grid is partially hidden by the fact that ERCOTs seasonal assessments, which are based entirely on historical weather, are too low. Prior to the 2021 winter blackout, ERCOT forecast an extreme peak load of 67 GW. In reality, we estimate hourly peak demand was 82 GW, 22% above ERCOT's most extreme forecast and about equal to the best-case available power. Given the high stakes, ERCOT should develop probabilistic estimates using modern scientific tools to predict the range of power demand more accurately.},

abstract = {We present a framework for incorporating weather uncertainty into electricity demand forecasting when weather patterns cannot be assumed to be stable, such as in climate change scenarios. This is done by first calibrating an econometric model for electricity demand on historical data, and subsequently applying the model to a large number of simulated weather paths, together with projections for the remaining determinants. Simulated weather paths are generated based on output from a global circulation model, using a method that preserves the trend and annual seasonality of the first and second moments, as well as the spatial and serial correlations. The application of the framework is demonstrated by creating long-term, probabilistic electricity demand forecasts for Brazil for the period 2016-2100 that incorporates weather uncertainty for three climate change scenarios. All three scenarios indicate steady growth in annual average electricity demand until reaching a peak of approximately 1071-1200 TWh in 2060, then subsequently a decline, largely reflecting the trajectory of the population projections. The weather uncertainty in all scenarios is significant, with up to 400 TWh separating the 10th and the 90th percentiles, or approximately ±17% relative to the mean.},

It reviews the available literature, where it exists, on the relationships among current energy demand, weather and climate change, and the implications for these relationships due to mitigation plans and potential adaptation responses. The review highlights the mechanisms by which future climate change, in particular changes in mean and extreme temperature, could affect the annual amount of UK energy demand and the seasonal, daily and spatial variation of the impacts. Published literature quantifying the effects of climate change on UK energy demand is limited; thus, where evidence is not available, information on the current relationship between weather and demand is combined with expert judgement to highlight potential demand responses to a changing climate without quantification. The impacts identified could have significant implications for the long-term planning of energy infrastructure and system operation and building design, depending on their magnitude, highlighting the need for further research in this area.},

We couple the Urban Climate and Energy Model with the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model as a full-height single column driven with a series of global climate model simulations in an ensemble approach. The framework is evaluated against observations, then a series of century-scale simulations are undertaken to examine projected climate change impacts on electricity and gas demand in the temperate/oceanic climate of Melbourne, Australia. With air-conditioning ownership remaining at early 21st century levels, and in the absence of other changes, climate change under radiative forcing RCP 8.5 increases peak electricity demand by 10%, and decreases peak gas demand by 22% between 2000 and 2100. However, if projected increases in air-conditioning ownership are considered, peak electricity demand increases by 84%, surpassing peak gas demand in the second half of the century. These findings highlight the complex nature of changes facing energy networks. Changes will be location and scenario dependent.},

abstract = {While most electricity systems are designed to handle peak demand during summer months, long-term energy pathways consistent with deep decarbonization generally electrify building heating, thus increasing electricity demand during winter. A key question is how climate variability and change will affect peak heating and cooling demand in an electrified future. We conduct a spatially explicit analysis of trends in temperature-based proxies of electricity demand over the past 70 years. Average annual demand for heating (cooling) decreases (increases) over most of the contiguous US. However, while climate change drives robust increases in peak cooling demand, trends in peak heating demand are generally smaller and less robust. Because the distribution of temperature exhibits a long left tail, severe cold snaps dominate the extremes of thermal demand. As building heating electrifies, system operators must account for these events to ensure reliability.},

Simulations were performed using the BEND (Building ENergy Demand) model which is a detailed building analysis platform utilizing EnergyPlus™ as the simulation engine. Over 26,000 building configurations of different types, sizes, vintages, and characteristics representing the population of buildings within the EIC, are modeled across the three EIC time zones using the future climate from 100 target region locations, resulting in nearly 180,000 spatially relevant simulated demand profiles for three years selected to be representative of the general climate trend over the century. This approach provides a heretofore unprecedented level of specificity across multiple spectrums including spatial, temporal, and building characteristics. This capability enables the ability to perform detailed hourly impact studies of building adaptation and mitigation strategies on energy use and electricity peak demand within the context of the entire grid and economy.},

abstract = {Investors, developers, policy makers and engineers are rightly concerned about the potential effects of climate change on the future performance of hydropower investments. Hydroelectricity offers potentially low greenhouse-gas emission, renewable energy and reliable energy storage. However, hydroelectricity developments are large, complicated projects and possibly critically vulnerable to changes in climate and other assumptions related to future uncertainties. This paper presents a general assessment approach for evaluating the resilience of hydroelectricity projects to uncertainty in climate and other risk factors (e.g., financial, natural hazard). The process uses a decision analytic framework based on a decision scaling approach, which combines scenario neutral analysis and vulnerability-specific probability assessment. The technical evaluation process involves identification of project objectives, specification of uncertain factors, multi-dimensional sensitivity analysis, and data mining to identify vulnerability-specific scenarios and vulnerability-specific estimations of risk. The process is demonstrated with an application to a proposed hydropower facility on the Arun River in Nepal. The findings of the case study illustrate an example in which climate change is not the critical future uncertainty, and consequently highlight the importance of considering multiple uncertainties in combination.},

Three different cases are developed: 1) Base Case, which gives the optimal electricity production mix, taking into account country's development plans (without climate change); 2) Climate Change Damage Case, which introduces the climate changes by adjusting the heating and cooling degree days inputs, consistent with the existing national climate scenarios; and 3) Climate Change Adaptation Case, in which the optimal electricity generation mix is determined by allowing for endogenous capacity adjustments in the model. This modeling exercise will identify the changes in the energy demand and in electricity generation mix in the Adaptation Case, as well as climate change damages and benefits of the adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Fourteen (14) regional climate simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) were analyzed for the study. The study evaluates the ability of the simulations to reproduce the present-day climate variables over Niger, builds a climate-electricity demand model to link the electricity demand with climate variables, and quantifies the potential impact of climate change on daily electricity demand at various global warming levels (GWLs: 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, 2.5 °C, and 3.0 °C) above the pre-industrial level. The climate-electricity demand model was built by combining the principal component analysis and the multiple linear regression analysis (hereafter, MLR). The residual analysis indicates that the MLR model complies with the assumptions of the regression analysis. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the MLR prediction is about 0.81, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 149.9 MWh day−1. The ensemble mean of the model simulations projects a future increase in electricity demand at all the GWLs, and more than 75% of the simulations agree on the projection. The study demonstrates how climate services could be used in quantifying the impacts of climate change on electricity demand, and the results would be valuable for reducing future climate risks in the energy sector.},

abstract = {Scholarly debates on energy and climate change have successfully foregrounded mitigation measures, but often overlook the role of energy in climate adaptation. Adaptation is of key importance to building resilience to climate change impacts, but its link with energy access has not been studied in detail. This study aims to address this research gap by examining the relation between electricity access and climate resilience in the context of Bally Island in the Indian Sundarbans. We deploy a qualitative research approach to investigate whether and how the electricity grid, installed to Bally in 2019, aids residents to build resilience against climate change impacts. Our case study highlights the importance of incorporating climate resilience into future energy planning. We find that benefits of electricity access can help people to become more resilient against climate change impacts. However, it is important to understand contextual limitations to building resilience with electricity. Our case study furthermore shows unintended consequences of grid connectivity that can negatively impact peoples' capacity to build resilience. For example, the untrustworthy electricity grid has led to the decline in popularity of solar PV systems, despite the fact that they are a more reliable alternative to the electricity grid. Therefore, we urge scholars and policy makers to consider the benefits, limitations, and unintended consequences of (planned) electricity measures on people's capacity to build resilience, especially in areas vulnerable to climate change.},

abstract = {Climate change may affect the US electricity system through changes in electricity demand, mediated by increases in average surface temperature, and through changes in electricity supply, mediated by changes in both surface temperature and regional water availability. By coupling projections from four general circulation models (GCMs) with a state-of-the-art US electricity system model—the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS)—this study evaluates both the isolated and combined effects of different climate-mediated drivers of US electricity system change through 2050. Comparing results across climate models allows us to evaluate which effects are robust to uncertainty in projected climate outcomes. Comparing effects of different drivers in isolation and in combination allows us to determine the relative contributions of the climate-mediated effects on system evolution. Our results indicate that national-level energy and economic impacts are largely driven by increases in electricity demand that follow from a consistent increase in surface air temperature that is largely robust to the choice of climate model. Other electricity system changes can be equally or more significant in some regions, but these effects are more regionally variable, less significant when aggregated to the national scale, and less robust to the choice of climate model. The findings show that the impacts of climate change on the electricity system can be understood in terms of fewer drivers and with greater certainty at the national level than at the regional level.},

abstract = {The demand for electricity affects the future climate through its effect on greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity generation process, but climate change also impacts electricity demand by changing the need for heating and cooling. Developing reliable temperature response functions (TRFs) that illustrate electricity demand as a function of temperature is key for decreasing uncertainty in future climate projections under a changing climate and for impact assessments of climate change on energy systems. However, this task is challenging because electricity demand is determined by multiple factors that interact in complicated ways because demand fluctuations represent timely human responses to given meteorological conditions. We propose a novel method to acquire reliable TRFs at a regional scale based on comprehensive modeling of electricity demand fluctuations. Six candidate algorithms were examined, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) was selected as the best algorithm with the dataset used. Using MARS, we constructed models with the capacity to precisely reproduce complex electricity demand patterns based on multiple predictors and simulated the impact of temperature on electricity demand while controlling for the effects of other factors. The temporal segments in TRFs are detected and parameters and functional forms of TRFs for 10 regions in Japan were presented.},

abstract = {The current research aims to optimize the water release to generate optimal hydropower generation for the future up to the year 2039. The study's novelty is the adaptive and nonadaptive rule curves for power production using optimization algorithms under the climate change model. In addition, the study used the RCP 8.5 scenario based on seven climate change models. A weighting method was used to select the best climate change models. The method can allocate more weights to more accurate models. The results revealed that the temperature increased by about 26% in the future, while precipitation would decreased by around 3%. The bat algorithm was also used, given it is a powerful method in solving optimization problems in water resources management. The results indicated that less power could be generated during the future period in comparison with the base period as there will be less inflow to the reservoir and released water for hydropower generation. However, by applying adaptive rule curves, the hydropower generation may be improved even under the climate change conditions. For example, the volumetric reliability index obtained when using adaptive rule curves (92%) was higher than when nonadaptive rule curves (90%) were applied. Also, the adoption of adaptive rule curves decreased the vulnerability index for the future period. Therefore, the bat algorithm with adaptive rule curves has a high potential for optimizing reservoir operations under the climate change conditions.},

However, the crucial role of climate change on hydropower production in India remains unexplored. Here using the observations and model simulations, we show that seven large hydropower projects experienced a significant (p-value < 0.05) warming and a decline in precipitation and streamflow during the observed period of 1951–2007. However, all the hydropower projects are projected to experience a warmer and wetter climate in the future. Multimodel ensemble mean annual average temperature (precipitation) is projected to rise up to 6.3 ± 1.6 °C (18 ± 14.6%) in the catchments upstream of the other reservoirs by the end of the 21st century under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. Due to the projected increase in precipitation, mean annual streamflow (up to +45%) and hydropower (up to +25%) production are projected to rise under the future climate. However, significant warming (6.25 ± 1.62 °C) is projected to result in a decline in streamflow and hydropower production in May- June for snow-dominated Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal hydropower projects.

Here we explore the possible consequences of these impacts for the electricity supply sector at the global scale. Regional hydropower projections are developed by forcing a coupled global hydrological and dam model with downscaled, bias-corrected climate realizations. Consequent impacts on power sector composition and associated emissions and investment costs are explored using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We find that climate-driven changes in hydropower generation may shift power demands onto and away from carbon intensive technologies. This causes significantly altered power sector CO2 emissions in several hydro-dependent regions, although the net global impact is modest. For drying regions, we estimate a global, cumulative investment need of approximately one trillion dollars (±$500 billion) this century to make up for deteriorated hydropower generation caused by climate change. Total investments avoided are of a similar magnitude across regions projected to experience increased precipitation. Investment risks and opportunities are concentrated in hydro-dependent countries for which significant climate change is expected. Various countries throughout the Balkans, Latin America and Southern Africa are most vulnerable, whilst Norway, Canada, and Bhutan emerge as clear beneficiaries.},

Here we project 21st century global hydropower production by forcing a coupled, global hydrological and dam model with three General Circulation Model (GCM) projections run under two emissions scenarios. Dams are simulated using a detailed model that accounts for plant specifications, storage dynamics, reservoir bathymetry and realistic, optimized operations. We show that the inclusion of these features can have a non-trivial effect on the simulated response of hydropower production to changes in climate. Simulation results highlight substantial uncertainty in the direction of change in globally aggregated hydropower production ($\sim$− 5 to + 5% change in mean global production by the 2080s under a high emissions scenario, depending on GCM). Several clearly impacted hotspots are identified, the most prominent of which encompasses the Mediterranean countries in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. In this region, hydropower production is projected to be reduced by approximately 40% on average by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario. After accounting for each country's dependence on hydropower for meeting its current electricity demands, the Balkans countries emerge as the most vulnerable ($\sim$ 5–20% loss in total national electricity generation depending on country). On the flipside, a handful of countries in Scandinavia and central Asia are projected to reap a significant increase in total electrical production ($\sim$ 5–15%) without investing in new power generation facilities.},

A methodology that combines simulation and optimization models is presented to formulate the optimal adaptive operation rules that consider the joint operation of cascade reservoirs. And the performance of the optimal adaptive operation rules is verified by comparing it with the conventional rules when both been applied to a case study of Hanjiang River hydropower plant reservoirs system. With the optimal adaptive operation chart, the cascade power generation assurance rate increased to 87%, the average annual power generation increased by 16.1%, and the power generation in typical wet, normal and dry years increased by 4.4%, 9% and 7.3%, respectively, compared with the conventional operation chart.},

The future climate conditions of the watershed are predicted by downscaling the outputs of A2 and B2 scenarios of the HadCM3 global circulation model for three time periods: 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099 (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively). The major change in temperature is predicted for 2080s for the A2 scenario, as the maximum and minimum temperatures are predicted to be increased by 1.5 °C and 2.8 °C, respectively. However, the average precipitation of the watershed is expected to decrease in all future time periods. HEC-HMS hydrological model is used to simulate the river discharges during baseline and future periods in the watershed. A decrease in discharge during the wet months (May to September) and an increase during the dry months (October to April) is projected in future time periods against the baseline period for both scenarios. Reservoir simulation is performed using HEC-ResSim in order to analyze the future change in power generation for different operating time settings. Assuming that the hydropower plant operates for 7 h/day during the baseline period (1982-2009), the average power production is expected to decrease by at least 30 % for both A2 and B2 scenarios in the future. Least reduction in power generation (8-13 %), against the baseline period, is observed when the reservoir is operated for 10 h/day in the dry months and 3 h/day in the wet months.

The machine learning algorithms considered include support vector regression, Gaussian processes, long short-term memory, non-linear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs, and a deep-learning neural networks model.

Final results are presented to the users through a user-friendly web interface developed from a tied connection with end-users in an effective co-design process. Methods are tested for forecasting the accumulated seasonal river discharges up to six months in advance for two catchments in Colombia, South America. Results indicate that the machine learning algorithms that make use of a complex and/or recurrent architecture can better simulate the temporal dynamic behaviour of the accumulated river discharge inflow to both case study reservoirs, thus rendering SCHT a useful tool in providing information for water resource managers in better planning the allocation of water resources for different users and for hydropower plant managers when negotiating power purchase contracts in competitive energy markets.},

Utilizing the strong linear relationship between the US Geological Survey WaterWatch runoff and annual hydropower generation, a runoff-based assessment approach is introduced in this study to project changes in annual and regional hydropower generation in multiple power marketing areas. Future climate scenarios are developed with a series of global and regional climate models, and the model output is bias-corrected to be consistent with observed data for the recent past. Using this approach, the median change in annual generation at federal projects is projected to be -2TWh, with an estimated ensemble uncertainty of ±9TWh. Although these estimates are similar to the recently observed variability in annual hydropower generation, and may therefore appear to be manageable, significantly seasonal runoff changes are projected and it may pose significant challenges in water systems with higher limits on reservoir storage and operational flexibility. Future assessments will be improved by incorporating next-generation climate models, by closer examination of extreme events and longer-term change, and by addressing the interactions among hydropower and other water uses.},

abstract = {Worldwide, 98% of total electricity is currently produced by thermoelectric power and hydropower. Climate change is expected to directly impact electricity supply, in terms of both water availability for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric power. Improved understanding of how climate change may impact the availability and temperature of water resources is therefore of major importance. Here we use a multi-model ensemble to show the potential impacts of climate change on global hydropower and cooling water discharge potential. For the first time, combined projections of streamflow and water temperature were produced with three global hydrological models (GHMs) to account for uncertainties in the structure and parametrization of these GHMs in both water availability and water temperature. The GHMs were forced with bias-corrected output of five general circulation models (GCMs) for both the lowest and highest representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The ensemble projections of streamflow and water temperature were then used to quantify impacts on gross hydropower potential and cooling water discharge capacity of rivers worldwide. We show that global gross hydropower potential is expected to increase between +2.4% (GCM-GHM ensemble mean for RCP 2.6) and +6.3% (RCP 8.5) for the 2080s compared to 1971–2000. The strongest increases in hydropower potential are expected for Central Africa, India, central Asia and the northern high-latitudes, with 18–33% of the world population living in these areas by the 2080s. Global mean cooling water discharge capacity is projected to decrease by 4.5-15% (2080s). The largest reductions are found for the United States, Europe, eastern Asia, and southern parts of South America, Africa and Australia, where strong water temperature increases are projected combined with reductions in mean annual streamflow. These regions are expected to affect 11–14% (for RCP2.6 and the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP)1, SSP2, SSP4) and 41–51% (RCP8.5–SSP3, SSP5) of the world population by the 2080s.},

abstract = {Expansion of wind energy installed capacity is poised to play a key role in climate change mitigation. However, wind energy is also susceptible to global climate change. Some changes associated with climate evolution will likely benefit the wind energy industry while other changes may negatively impact wind energy developments, with such 'gains and losses' depending on the region under consideration. Herein we review possible mechanisms by which global climate variability and change may influence the wind energy resource and operating conditions, summarize some of the tools that are being employed to quantify these effects and the sources of uncertainty in making such projections, and discuss results of studies conducted to date. We present illustrative examples of research from northern Europe. Climate change analyses conducted for this region, which has shown considerable penetration of wind energy, imply that in the near-term (i.e. to the middle of the current century) natural variability exceeds the climate change signal in the wind energy resource and extreme wind speeds, but there will likely be a decline in icing frequency and sea ice both of which will tend to benefit the wind energy industry. By the end of the twenty-first century there is evidence for small magnitude changes in the wind resource (though the sign of the change remains uncertain), for increases in extreme wind speeds, and continued declines in sea ice and icing frequencies. Thus the current state-of-the-art suggests no detectable change in the wind resource or other external conditions that could jeopardize the continued exploitation of wind energy in northern Europe, though further research is needed to provide greater confidence in these projections. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Climate change impact on future European large-scale wind energy resource under the latest IPCC CMIP5 future climate projections were analysed. After assessing the models that best reproduce contemporary near-surface wind speeds over Europe, their data was used to assess future changes in the wind energetic resource in Europe. Using a multi-model ensemble composed by the models that showed the best ability to represent contemporary near-surface wind speeds over Europe, the future European large-scale wind energetic resource is projected to increase in Northern-Central Europe (Baltic Sea and surrounding areas), and decrease in the Mediterranean region, mainly by the end of the current century and under stronger radiative forcing scenarios. It is also projected an increase of the intra-annual variability in the Baltic Sea and surrounding areas and a decrease in Mediterranean areas, but no significant changes in the inter-annual variability are expected over Europe. Despite the large uncertainty associated to future climate projections, the findings of this work can serve as background for future downscaling of CMIP5 data to regional-local scales focused on climate change impacts on wind energy, and should be seen as a preliminary warning that a continuous increase of greenhouse gases emissions are expected to impact European wind energy production.},

Globally, a potential increase in cooling demand and decrease in heating demand can be anticipated, in contrast to slight decreases in hydropower and thermal energy capacity. Impacts at the regional scale are more mixed and relatively uncertain across regions, but strongest impacts are reported for South Asia and Latin America. Our assessment shows that climate impacts on energy systems at regional and global scales are uncertain due partly to the wide range of methods and non-harmonized datasets used.

Expansion planning of electricity infrastructure is critical to support investment and maintaining balanced consumer electricity prices. Variations in water availability due to a changing climate could leave hydro infrastructure stranded or result in underutilization of available resources. In this study, we develop a framework consisting of long-term models for electricity supply and water systems management, to assess the vulnerability of potential expansion plans to the effects of climate change. We find that the most resilient EAPP rollout strategy corresponds to a plan optimised for a slightly wetter climate compared to historical trends. This study demonstrates that failing to climate-proof infrastructure investments can result in significant electricity price fluctuations in selected countries (Uganda & Tanzania) while others, such as Egypt, are less vulnerable.},

However, previous studies have not formally examined how these dimensions individually and jointly contribute to variability in benefits across locations or EE/RE types. Here, we develop and demonstrate a high-resolution model to simulate and compare the monetized public health and climate benefits of four different illustrative EE/RE installation types in six different locations within the Mid-Atlantic and Lower Great Lakes of the United States.

Here we explore how models have consistently underestimated PV deployment and identify the reasons for underlying bias in models. Our analysis reveals that rapid technological learning and technology-specific policy support were crucial to PV deployment in the past, but that future success will depend on adequate financing instruments and the management of system integration.

The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 20 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming today's technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual.},

It presents a review of the impacts that climate change may have throughout the energy chain and identifies current knowledge gaps and areas for future research development. One of the greatest challenges is how to assess impacts which may occur as a consequence of the projected increase in the intensity of extreme weather events: the majority of current methodologies rely on past experience but this may not be a sufficiently good guide for planning and operational activities in the coming decades. Also, climate impact assessments on energy planning and operation need to take into account a greater number of scenarios, as well as investigate impacts on particular energy segments. Therefore, we identify energy segments for which little climate impact research has been conducted.

abstract = {Modern electricity distribution networks are critical and highly complex infrastructures built to provide consumers with an uninterruptible and reliable power supply under normal operating conditions and common failures or expected disturbances. Although these infrastructures have attained increased reliability levels, they cannot effectively resist high-impact, low-frequency incidents, such as extreme weather events. In parallel, electricity distribution grids are aging and were designed for climate bands that are now obsolete because of the changing climate and the subsequent weather extremes; this has left infrastructure operating outside of its tolerance levels. This paper aims to provide a methodology resource for Operators to support decision-making regarding the resilience enhancement of power networks at the distribution level (not generation or transmission) in the face of meteorological disasters. More specifically, the study proposes an approach to address climate change impacts on the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network in alignment with the European Commission's technical guidance on the climate-proofing of infrastructure during 2021–2027, representing best practices in the field. Both a climate vulnerability and a risk assessment are performed in the distribution networks across Greece, employing IPCC's RCP 8.5 scenario and encompassing the Information Hub for Greece's Adaptation to Climate Change. The assessment includes reviewing related literature/historical data and conducting a climate hazard perception survey to harness technical experts' judgment of network sensitivity and climate impacts on infrastructure. The ArcMap software is used to map vulnerability and risk for the selected acute (wildfire, flood, rainfall, high wind, lightning, snowfall, heatwave) and chronic climate hazards (drought, humidity, ambient temperature rise, sea level rise, landslide, coastal erosion). Furthermore, the Monte Carlo simulation process is utilized to capture the likelihood of different hazard groups and estimate the risk spread in various areas in Greece. Future research can integrate additional RCP scenarios or more updated climate projections once available.},

The results indicate that for the G7 countries, higher GHG emissions are associated with an increase in electricity generation and primary energy consumption. In contrast, for BRICS nations, only the PMG ARDL model identifies a positive relationship between rising GHG emissions and electricity generation, while all models indicate that higher emissions are linked to increased energy consumption.

However, the production of hydropower is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This study aims to assess how climate change affects the potential production of hydropower at Dez Dam in Western Iran. To do this, we used five General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to project future temperatures and precipitation. We applied the Quantile Mapping (QM) method to correct any biases in the GCMs' output for two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP245 and SSP585, during the periods 2025–2054 and 2071–2100. We calibrated, validated, and used a regional Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate future reservoir inflow. Next, we employed the River Basin Management Decision Support System (MODSIM-DSS) to quantify hydropower production in response to changing inflow. Our findings indicate that (1) temperatures are expected to increase in both future periods and SSPs, (2) different GCMs project different precipitation patterns, and (3) according to the average results from the five GCMs, reservoir inflow and hydropower generation are projected to decrease by 4% and 7% in 2025–2054, and by 8.6% and 13.8% in 2071–2100 under the worst-case scenario SSP585, respectively. These results provide valuable insights for long-term management planning and decision-making processes for the Dez hydropower plant.},

One such approach is direct air CO <sub>2</sub> capture and storage (DACCS), a readily available, yet energy-intensive process. The combination of DACCS and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) allows for independently powered carbon capture plants to inject concentrated carbon into deep marine sediments where storage is generally safe and permanent. OTEC is a form of electricity production that exploits the temperature difference between deep and shallow ocean waters, and can power DACCS on floating platforms at a price competitive with coal-generated electricity. Here we highlight the scale of the challenge facing society. We show that a safe and sustainable level of OTEC-generated electricity powering DACCS for 70 years could result in up to a 35% decrease in the relative global mean temperature warming compared to a business-as-usual emissions scenario. </p>},

However, energy demand patterns and supply systems are themselves subject to climate change impacts. These impacts will variously help and hinder mitigation and adaptation efforts, so it is vital they are well understood and incorporated into models used to study energy system decarbonisation pathways. To assess the current state of understanding of this topic and identify research priorities, this paper critically reviews the literature on the impacts of climate change on the energy supply system, summarising the regional coverage of studies, trends in their results and sources of disagreement. We then examine the ways in which these impacts have been represented in integrated assessment models of the electricity or energy system. Studies tend to agree broadly on impacts for wind, solar and thermal power stations. Projections for impacts on hydropower and bioenergy resources are more varied. Key uncertainties and gaps remain due to the variation between climate projections, modelling limitations and the regional bias of research interests. Priorities for future research include the following: further regional impact studies for developing countries; studies examining impacts of the changing variability of renewable resources, extreme weather events and combined hazards; inclusion of multiple climate feedback mechanisms in IAMs, accounting for adaptation options and climate model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Hydropower plays a major role in the Portuguese electrical mix. Given the projected impacts of climate change on the availability of water resources, effects on hydropower generation are widely recognized though scantily quantified in literature. Considering projected climate change impacts on water resources in Portugal, we use a partial equilibrium bottom-up optimization model (TIMES_PT) to assess the effects of climate change on the Portuguese electrical system by 2050 – particularly focusing on the impacts on water resources availability and hydropower generation. Results show that hydropower generation may decrease by 41% in 2050. Hydropower will remain one of the most cost-effective technologies in the power sector, though it will lose as compared to other renewable energy sources (solar PV and wind power) due to, not only, the almost fully exploited endogenous hydropower potential, but also, due to climate change impacts. This will result in higher electricity prices (up to a 17% increase). Moreover, the stronger the climate change impacts the higher the levels of greenhouse gas emissions (up to 7.2% increase) – thus demanding stronger political action to comply with EU climate goals for 2050.},

abstract = {Climate change will have large impacts on water resources and its predictions are fraught with uncertainties in West Africa. With the current global drive for renewable energy due to climate change, there is a need for understanding the effects of hydro-climatic changes on water resources and hydropower generation. A hydrological model was used to model runoff inflow into the largest hydroelectric dam (Kainji) in the Niger Basin (West Africa) under present and future conditions. Inflow to the reservoir was simulated using hydro-climatic data from a set of dynamically downscaled 8 global climate models (GCM) with two emission scenarios from the CORDEX-Africa regional downscaling experiment, driven with CMIP5 data. Observed records of the Kainji Lake were used to develop a hydroelectricity production model to simulate future energy production for the reservoir. Results indicate an increase in inflow into the reservoir and concurrent increases in hydropower production for the majority of the GCM data under the two scenarios. This analysis helps planning hydropower schemes for sustainable hydropower production.},

We integrate a model of major surface-water reservoirs with an electric grid dispatch model, and perturb it by projected runoff based on representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results show that climate change and variability is expected to decrease the average annual hydropower generation by 3.1% under RCP4.5, but have negligible impact under the RCP8.5. Model simulations indicate more inflow, caused by more future extremes, in the future that does not necessarily translate to more energy production because of reservoir spillage of water. While overall volume of future available water for energy production may be similar or higher, the delivery of this volume is expected to be significantly more variable in the future climate than the historical average, which has many implications for hydropower generation. Our results show that the expected changes in future climate leads to increases in grid GHG emissions, load-following capacity, fuel usage, and costs for the RCP4.5 due to generation shortfall, and very slight increases in the same metrics for the RCP8.5 case due to variability causing decreased efficiencies in load-following power plants.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter regional hydrological regimes, affecting the operation and performance of reservoirs and hydropower facilities. This study examines the impacts of climate change on the performance of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) by means of a detailed daily reservoir regulation and hydropower model, linked to a physically-based hydrological model, and driven by an ensemble of five General Circulation Models (GCMs) under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). As precipitation in the basin is expected to increase, the projected mean annual inflow and hydropower generation of the TGR will increase by 3.3–5.6% and 0.9–2.3% in 2040–2065, 7.9%-15.2% and 5.2–8.1% in 2080–2099 respectively. These increases are only statistically significant for 2080–2099 and are seasonally concentrated in the spring before the flood season and the early autumn during the end of the flood season. However, the inter-annual variation of power generation will increase strongly in the dry season. The reservoir performance is highly sensitive to the changes in the seasonal distribution and extremes of streamflow. Increases in streamflow that occur in the flood season cause significant increases in the amount of spilled water and advance the time when the reservoir reaches the normal storage level. Additionally, increases in both the inter-annual variation of inflow and the intensity of inflow shortages during extreme drought years in the impounding stage drive decreases in the fully filled rate and average water storage level in the dry season. The utilization rate of water resources under projected extreme streamflow is expected to decrease, reshaping the response of power generation to climate change into a non-linear pattern where increases in streamflow do not proportionally translate to increases in power generation. These findings highlight the complexity of hydropower management and production under future climate change scenarios, motivating the need for introducing detailed regulating models for impact assessment studies and adaptive adjustment of the reservoir management to combat climate change.},

abstract = {Hydropower is a clean, renewable, and environmentally friendly source of energy. It produces 3930 (TW.h).a−1, and yields 16% of the world's generated electricity and about 78% of renewable electricity generation (in 2015). Hydropower and climate change show a double relationship. On the one hand, as an important renewable energy resource, hydropower contributes significantly to the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to the mitigation of global warming. On the other hand, climate change is likely to alter river discharge, impacting water availability and hydropower generation. Hydropower contributes significantly to the reduction of GHG emissions and to energy supply security. Compared with conventional coal power plants, hydropower prevents the emission of about 3 GT CO2 per year, which represents about 9% of global annual CO2 emissions. Hydropower projects may also have an enabling role beyond the electricity sector, as a financing instrument for multipurpose reservoirs and as an adaptive measure regarding the impacts of climate change on water resources, because regulated basins with large reservoir capacities are more resilient to water resource changes, less vulnerable to climate change, and act as a storage buffer against climate change. At the global level, the overall impact of climate change on existing hydropower generation may be expected to be small, or even slightly positive. However, there is the possibility of substantial variations across regions and even within countries. In conclusion, the general verdict on hydropower is that it is a cheap and mature technology that contributes significantly to climate change mitigation, and could play an important role in the climate change adaptation of water resource availability. However, careful attention is necessary to mitigate the substantial environmental and social costs. Roughly more than a terawatt of capacity could be added in upcoming decades.},

abstract = {An electricity generation planning framework incorporating adaptation to hydro-climatic change is presented. The planning framework internalizes risks and opportunities associated with alternative hydro-climate scenarios to identify a long-term system configuration robust to uncertainty. The implications of a robust response to hydro-climatic change are demonstrated for the electricity system in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Adaptation strategy is crucial in this region, mainly due to the large contribution of hydropower resources to regional electricity supply. Analysis of results from basin-scale hydrologic models driven with downscaled global climate data suggest that shifts in regional streamflow characteristics by the year 2050 are likely to increase BC's annual hydropower potential by more than 10 %. These effects combined with an estimated decrease in electricity demand by 2 % due to warmer temperatures, could provide an additional 11 TWh of annual energy. Uncertainties in these projected climate impacts indicate technology configurations offering significant long-term operational flexibility will be needed to ensure system reliability. Results from the regional long-term electricity generation model incorporating adaptive capacity show the significant shifts required in the non-hydro capacity mix to ensure system robustness cause an increase in cumulative operating costs of between 1 and 7 %. Analysis of technology configurations involving high-penetrations of wind generation highlights interactions between flexibility requirements occurring over multiple temporal scales.},

abstract = {Hydropower represents the world's largest renewable energy source. As a flexible technology, it enhances reliability and security of the electricity system. However, climate change and market liberalization may hinder investment due to the evolution of water runoffs and electricity prices. Both alter expected revenue and bring uncertainty. It increases risk and deters investment. Our research assesses how climate change and market fluctuation affect annual revenue. But this paper focuses on the uncertainty, rather than on forecasting. This transdisciplinary topic is investigated by means of a mixed method, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative approach uses established models in natural sciences and economics. The uncertainty is accounted for by applying various scenarios and various datasets coming from different models. Based on those results, uncertainty is discussed through an analysis discerning three dimensions of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis requires the assessment of a large panel of models and data sets. It is therefore rarely carried out. The originality of the paper also lies on the combination of quantitative established models with a qualitative analysis. The results surprisingly show that the greenhouse gas scenarios may in fact represent a low source of uncertainty, unlike electricity prices. Like forecasting, the main uncertainties are actually case study related and depend on the investigated variables. It is also shown that the nature of uncertainty evolves. Runoff uncertainty goes from variability, i.e. inherent randomness, to epistemic, i.e. limitation of science. The reverse situation occurs with the electricity price. The implications for scientists and policy makers are discussed.},

abstract = {Los Angeles County (LAC) is a large urbanized region with 9.7 million residents (as of 2010) and aging infrastructure. Population forecasts indicate that LAC will become home to an additional 1.2–3.1 million residents through 2060. Additionally, climate forecasts based upon representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 indicate that average air temperatures will increase by 1–4 °C (2–7 °F) in the region. Both of these factors are expected to result in higher summertime peak electricity demand due to growth in the number of buildings, the percentage of installed air conditioners (ACs), and the additional cooling load on those air conditioners. In order to understand potential power reliability issues, and support infrastructure planning efforts, a long-term peak demand forecast was developed using hourly residential and commercial (R&C) building energy models. Peak hour electricity demand was estimated to increase from 9.5 to 12.8 GW for R&C sectors, to 13.0–17.3 GW (2–36%) and 14.7–19.2 GW (16–51%) by 2060 for the population forecasts from the California Department of Finance and the Southern California Association of Governments respectively. While marginal increases in ambient air temperature due to climate change accounted for only 4–8% of future increases in peak demand, differences in annual maximum temperatures within the 20-year periods affected results by 40–66% indicating a high sensitivity to heat waves. Population growth of at least 1 million people is anticipated to occur mostly in the northern cities of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Santa Clarita, bringing an additional 0.4–1 GW of peak demand in those regions. Building and AC efficiency are anticipated to improve as national and state efficiency standards increase, and as older, less efficient units are replaced; this could offset some of the projected increases in peak demand. Additionally, development of shared wall, multi-family dwelling units could enable population growth of up to 3 million people without increasing peak demand.},

On the demand side, climate change could shift demand patterns due to increased air temperatures. On the supply side, climate change could lead to deratings of thermal units due to changes in air temperature, water temperature, and water availability. Past studies have typically analyzed these risks separately. Here, we developed an integrated, multimodel framework to analyze how compounding risks of climate-change impacts on demand and supply affect long-term planning decisions in the power system. In the southeast U.S., we found that compounding climate-change impacts could result in a 35% increase in installed capacity by 2050 relative to the reference case. Participation of renewables, particularly solar, in the fleet increased, driven mostly by the expected increase in summertime peak demand. Such capacity requirements would increase investment costs by approximately 31 billion (USD 2015) over the next 30 years, compared to the reference case. These changes in investment decisions align with carbon emission mitigation strategies, highlighting how adaptation and mitigation strategies can converge.},

abstract = {Rising ambient temperatures due to climate change will increase urban populations' exposures to extreme heat. During hot hours, a key protective adaptation is increased air conditioning and associated consumption of electricity for cooling. But during cold hours, milder temperatures have the offsetting effect of reducing consumption of electricity and other fuels for heating. We elucidate the net consequences of these opposing effects in 36 cities in different world regions. We couple reduced-form statistical models of cities' hourly responses of electric load to temperature with temporally downscaled projections of temperatures simulated by 21 global climate models (GCMs), projecting the effects of warming on the demand for electricity circa 2050. Cities' responses, temperature exposures and impacts are heterogeneous, with changes in total annual consumption ranging from - 2.7 to 5.7%, and peak power demand increasing by as much as 9.5% at the multi-GCM median. The largest increases are concentrated in more economically developed mid-latitude cities, with less developed urban areas in the tropics exhibiting relatively small changes. The results highlight the important role of the structure of electricity demand: large temperature increases in tropical cities are offset by their inelastic responses, which can be attributed to lower air-conditioning penetration.},

abstract = {Climate change threatens all parts of the US electric power system, from electricity generation to distribution. An important dimension of this issue is the impact on electricity demand. While many studies have looked at these impacts, few have tried to represent this effect at higher temporal resolutions (such as daily or sub-daily) or to analyze its seasonal aspects. Our study expands on previous work to improve our understanding of how climate change can affect patterns of hourly electricity demand, the differences in these effects over different seasons, and how this in turn could affect the operations of the power system. For this analysis, we combine a linear regression model, a simplified economic dispatch model, and projections from twenty different climate models to analyze how climate change may affect seasonal demand patterns and, consequently, power plants dispatch. We use this method to analyze a case study of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The results suggest that climate change can result in an average increase in annual electricity consumption in the TVA region of 6% by the end of the century and an increase in the frequency of peak demand values (the maximum quantity of electricity demanded during an hour). However, this increase is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. During summer, total electricity consumption can increase on average by 20% while during winter, it may decrease on average by 6% by the end of the century. Such changes in demand could result in changes in the typical dispatch patterns of TVA's power plants. Estimated summer time capacity factors would increase (8 to 37% for natural gas and 71 to 84% for coal) and winter time capacity factor decrease (3% to virtually zero for natural gas and 67 to 60% for coal). Such results could affect the decision-making process of planning agents in the power sector.},

Taking into account 14 quantitative influencing factors, the susceptibility of each country is examined both for the current and projected system with the result being a relative ranked index. Luxembourg and Greece are the most susceptible relatively due in part to their inability to meet their own electricity consumption demand with inland production, and the fact that the majority of their production is from more susceptible sources, primarily combustible fuels. Greece experiences relatively warm mean temperatures, which are expected to increase in the future leading to greater summer electricity consumption, increasing susceptibility. Norway was found to be the least susceptible, relatively, due to its consistent production surplus, which is primarily from hydro (a less susceptible source) and a likely decrease of winter electricity consumption as temperatures rise due to climate change. The findings of this study enable countries to identify the main factors that increase their electricity system susceptibility and proceed with adaptation measures that are the most effective in decreasing susceptibility. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {High average temperatures lead to high regional electricity demand for cooling buildings, and large populations generally require more aggregate electricity than smaller ones do. Thus, future global climate and population changes will present regional infrastructure challenges regarding changing electricity demand. However, without spatially explicit representation of this demand or the ways in which it might change at the neighbourhood scale, it is difficult to determine which electricity service areas are most vulnerable and will be most affected by these changes. Here we show that detailed projections of changing local electricity demand patterns are viable and important for adaptation planning at the urban level in a changing climate. Employing high-resolution and spatially explicit tools, we find that electricity demand increases caused by temperature rise have the greatest impact over the next 40 years in areas serving small populations, and that large population influx stresses any affected service area, especially during peak demand.},

The dynamical simulation model HiREPS of the Austrian and German electricity, heating and cooling sectors was used for this analysis. The electricity generation cost and changes in the required secured capacity were used as indicators for the resilience of the energy system. The results show, that the analysed changes in the natural gas price have larger impact on the electricity generation cost than weather variability between different years or climate change. Especially the fossil fuel based scenario showed high sensitivity to the gas price. Analysis of the required secured capacity shows, that in the last quarter of the 21st century the annual maximum residual loads are growing and are dominated by strong cooling demand peaks. Promoting passive cooling options, efficient building designs and options for a controlled down regulation of cooling devices seems to be advisable to avoid installing large thermal power plant backup capacities. The evaluated climate model simulations show only small changes in photovoltaic, wind and hydro power generation for 2051−2080 in Austria and Germany.},

abstract = {Ongoing climate change affects complex and long-lived infrastructures like electricity systems. Particularly for decarbonized electricity systems based on variable renewable energies, there is a variety of impact mechanisms working differently in size and direction. Main impacts for Europe include changes in wind and solar resources, hydro power, cooling water availability for thermoelectric generation and electricity demand. Hence, it is not only important to understand the total effects, i.e., how much welfare may be gained when accounting for climate change impacts in all dimensions, but also to disentangle various effects in terms of their marginal contribution to the potential welfare loss. This paper applies a two-stage modeling framework to assess very strong climate change impacts on a cost-optimally decarbonized, highly renewables-based European electricity system. Thereby, the performance of two electricity system design strategies – one based on no anticipation of climate change and one anticipating impacts of climate change – is studied under a variety of climate change impacts. Impacts on wind and solar resources are found to cause the largest system effects in 2100. Combined climate change impacts increase system costs of a system designed without climate change anticipation due to increased fuel and carbon permit costs. Applying a system design strategy with climate change anticipation increases the cost-optimal share of variable renewable energy based on additional wind offshore capacity in 2100, at a reduction in nuclear, wind onshore and solar photovoltaics capacity. Compared to a no anticipation strategy, total system costs are reduced.},

abstract = {Recent warm, dry summers showed the vulnerability of the European power sector to low water availability and high river temperatures. Climate change is likely to impact electricity supply, in terms of both water availability for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric power production. Here, we show the impacts of climate change and changes in water availability and water temperature on European electricity production and prices. Using simulations of daily river flows and water temperatures under future climate (2031-2060) in power production models, we show declines in both thermoelectric and hydropower generating potential for most parts of Europe, except for the most northern countries. Based on changes in power production potentials, we assess the cost-optimal use of power plants for each European country by taking electricity import and export constraints into account. Higher wholesale prices are projected on a mean annual basis for most European countries (except for Sweden and Norway), with strongest increases for Slovenia (12-15%), Bulgaria (21-23%) and Romania (31-32% for 2031-2060), where limitations in water availability mainly affect power plants with low production costs. Considering the long design life of power plant infrastructures, short-term adaptation strategies are highly recommended to prevent undesired distributional and allocative effects. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We calibrate residential energy use against metered data, accounting for differences in building materials and appliances. Under temperature increases, we find that without policy intervention, residential electricity demand could increase by as much as 41-87% between 2020 and 2060. However, aggressive policies aimed at upgrading heating/cooling systems and appliances could result in electricity use increases as low as 28%, potentially avoiding the installation of new generation capacity.

abstract = {Climate change affects consumer expenditures by altering the consumption of and price for electricity. Previous analyses focus solely on the former, which implicitly assumes that climate-induced changes in consumption do not affect price. But this assumption is untenable because a shift in demand alters quantity and price at equilibrium. Here we present the first empirical estimates for the effect of climate change on electricity prices. Translated through the merit order dispatch of existing capacity for generating electricity, climate-induced changes in daily and monthly patterns of electricity consumption cause non-linear changes in electricity prices. A 2 °C increase in global mean temperature increases the prices for and consumption of electricity in Massachusetts USA, such that the average household's annual expenditures on electricity increase by about 12%. Commercial customers incur a 9% increase. These increases are caused largely by higher prices for electricity, whose impacts on expenditures are 1.3 and 3.6 fold larger than changes in residential and commercial consumption, respectively. This suggests that previous empirical studies understate the effects of climate change on electricity expenditures and that policy may be needed to ensure that the market generates investments in peaking capacity to satisfy climate-driven changes in summer-time consumption.},

We provide evidence on nonlinear and extreme weather effects on electricity prices. In all countries, reductions in temperature below a certain threshold increase electricity prices, yet these thresholds tend to be lower for colder countries than for warmer ones. In addition, warmer countries have an upper threshold above which temperatures also increase prices. The precipitation threshold is near the maximum for countries with limited hydroelectric generation and much lower for others with high hydropower capacity, such as Norway. Wind speed has a similar effect on electricity prices across countries, while irradiance has a statistically significant effect in countries with the highest solar capacity and higher average irradiance. Ultimately, the impact of weather conditions on electricity prices is influenced by a country's initial climatic conditions, generation mix, policies, energy efficiency levels, and behavioral factors. Policies aimed at reducing the disproportionately negative impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations should ideally be informed by accurate quantification of the impact of weather on electricity prices.},

abstract = {Globally, electricity generation accounts for a large and potentially growing water demand, and as such is an important component to assessments of global and regional water scarcity. However, the current suite-as well as potential future suite-of thermoelectric generation technologies has a very wide range of water demand intensities, spanning two orders of magnitude. As such, the evolution of the generation mix is important for the future water demands of the sector. This study uses GCAM, an integrated assessment model, to analyze the global electric sector's water demands in three futures of climate change mitigation policy and two technology strategies. We find that despite five- to seven-fold expansion of the electric sector as a whole from 2005 to 2095, global electric sector water withdrawals remain relatively stable, due to the retirement of existing power plants with water-intensive once-through flow cooling systems. In the scenarios examined here, climate policies lead to the large-scale deployment of advanced, low-emissions technologies such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), concentrating solar power, and engineered geothermal systems. In particular, we find that the large-scale deployment of CCS technologies does not increase long-term water consumption from hydrocarbon-fueled power generation as compared with a no-policy scenario without CCS. Moreover, in sensitivity scenarios where low-emissions electricity technologies are required to use dry cooling systems, we find that the consequent additional costs and efficiency reductions do not limit the utility of these technologies in achieving cost-effective whole-system emissions mitigation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Annual electricity demand is projected to rise by about 6% compared to a 'no climate change' case. Although these additional power requirements are not very remarkable on an annual basis, total costs up to 2050, which may exceed 730 million Euros at today's prices, imply that the country may need to forgo one or two years of economic growth in order to cope with extra electricity needs due to climate change. This outlook indicates that a reasonable future energy path in regions with Mediterranean climate would involve substantial deployment of solar-powered electricity generation, which can meet peak load requirements while reducing the country's energy dependence. Moreover, this forecast highlights the need for adaptation to climate change through investments in the improvement of the energy performance of the building stock.},

First, demand for electricity is affected because of changes in the temperature. Second, changes in precipitation and temperature have impact on supply of hydro electric production through a shift in the inflow of water. Third, plant efficiency for thermal generation will decrease because the temperature of water used to cool equipment increases. To find the magnitude of these partial effects, as well as the overall effects, on Western European energy markets, we use the multi-market equilibrium model LIBEMOD. We find that each of the three partial effects changes the average electricity producer price by less than 2%, while the net effect is an increase of only 1%. The partial effects on total electricity supply are small, and the net effect is a decrease of 4%. The greatest effects are found for Nordic countries with a large market share for reservoir hydro. In these countries, annual production of electricity increases by 8%, reflecting more inflow of water, while net exports doubles. In addition, because of lower inflow in summer and higher in winter, the reservoir filling needed to transfer water from summer to winter is drastically reduced in the Nordic countries. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

During recent warm, dry summers several thermoelectric power plants in Europe and the southeastern United States were forced to reduce production owing to cooling-water scarcity2-4. Here we show that thermoelectric power in Europe and the United States is vulnerable to climate change owing to the combined impacts of lower summer river flows and higher river water temperatures. Using a physically based hydrological and water temperature modelling framework in combination with an electricity production model, we show a summer average decrease in capacity of power plants of 6.3-19% in Europe and 4.4-16% in the United States depending on cooling system type and climate scenario for 2031-2060. In addition, probabilities of extreme (>90%) reductions in thermoelectric power production will on average increase by a factor of three.

abstract = {Climate change will impact electricity markets through both electricity demand and supply. This paper reviews the research on this topic. Whereas there is much that remains unknown or uncertain, research over the last few years has significantly advanced our knowledge. In general, higher temperatures are expected to raise electricity demand for cooling, decrease demand for heating, and to reduce electricity production from thermal power plants. The effect of climate change on the supply of electricity from non-thermal sources shows great geographical variability due to differences in expected changes to temperature and precipitation. Whereas the research frontier has advanced significantly in the last few years, there still remains a significant need for more research in order to better understand the effects of climate change on the electricity market. Four significant gaps in the current research are regional studies of demand side impacts for Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America, the effects of extreme weather events on electricity generation, transmission and demand, changes to the adoption rate of air conditioning, and finally, our understanding of the sensitivity of thermal power supply to changes in air and water temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Haguma2014,
abstract = {This paper examines climate change impacts on the water resources system of the Manicouagan River (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada). The objective is to evaluate the performance of existing infrastructures under future climate projections and the associated uncertainties. The main purpose of the water resources system is hydropower production. A reservoir optimization algorithm, Sampling Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SSDP), was used to derive weekly operating decisions for the existing system subject to reservoir inflows reflecting future climate, for optimum hydropower production. These projections are simulations from the SWAT hydrologic model for climate change scenarios for the period from 2010 to 2099. Results show that the climate change will alter the hydrological regime of the study area: earlier timing of the spring flood, reduced spring peak flow, and increased annual inflows volume in the future compared to the historical climate. The SSDP optimization algorithm adapted the operating policy to the future hydrological regime by adjusting water reservoir levels in the winter and spring, and increasing the release through turbines, which in the end increased power generation. However, there could be more unproductive spills for some power plants, which would decrease the overall efficiency of the existing water resources system.},

abstract = {Renewable sources of electricity, such as solar and wind, need to be paired with sources of reliable baseload. Hydropower is a renewable, low-emission source of electricity baseload available throughout much of the world as an alternative to electricity conventionally provided by thermal combustion of fossil fuels; however, the global hydropower sector as it stands relies upon surface water flows of substantial and predictable volume. This makes it vulnerable to climate change. The impact of climate change on the hydropower sector is difficult to predict, and not globally uniform. It might be positive, negative, or inconsequential depending upon the local timing and magnitude of changes, reservoir size, allocation priority, and the energy market. The secondary effects of climate change on glacier lake outbursts floods, landslides, and sediment load are poorly understood. In addition, when planning hydropower projects for the future, attention must be given to the greenhouse gas contribution of the impounded waters behind storage dams, and the impact of dams on water temperature. In the past decade, sovereign nations and international development agencies worldwide have evaluated the potential of hydropower as a cost-effective, clean, sustainable option for baseload electricity supply. There is therefore a crucial need to assess the opportunities and risks hydropower poses across a wide range of potential future climate conditions. This review paper conducts a global survey of the literature on the effect of climate change on hydropower and identifies room for improvement in current approaches to evaluation of the net benefits of hydropower projects under climate change. This article is categorized under: Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and Analogies Assessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change.},

@article{Li2020,
abstract = {Climate change has emerged as a key issue for hydropower management and development in future. This study systematically evaluates the impact of climate change on reservoir inflow, hydropower output, sustainability, and efficiency under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) by taking the Pearl River basin in China as the case. The variable infiltration capacity model is coupled with global climate models to project future hydropower changes. It is shown that future reservoir inflow and hydropower output significantly differ from the historical ones. Dry years in future are projected to become drier leading to decrease in hydropower output that in turn reduces hydropower reliability and resiliency and increases the vulnerability. Wet years would get wetter, but the hydropower output does not necessarily increase possibly due to more surplus water released from reservoirs during flood seasons. For normal years, neither of reservoir inflow and hydropower output displays obvious changes. Moreover, water use efficiency of the West River in wet years and that of the North River in wet, normal and dry years would be lower in future, while the East River during non-flood seasons in dry years is expected to have higher water use efficiency. Our study can potentially provide an insight into the response of hydropower to climate change and help policy-makers and stakeholders manage future hydropower generation.},

abstract = {Climate change will have potentially significant effects on hydropower generation due to changes in the magnitude and seasonality of river runoff and increases in reservoir evaporation. These physical impacts will in turn have economic consequences through both producer revenues and consumer expenditures. We analyze the physical and economic effects of changes in hydropower generation for the contiguous U.S. in futures with and without global-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and across patterns from 18 General Circulation Models. Using a monthly water resources systems model of 2119 river basins that routes simulated river runoff through reservoirs, and allocates water to potentially conflicting and climate dependent demands, we provide a first-order estimate of the impacts of various projected emissions outcomes on hydropower generation, and monetize these impacts using outputs from an electric sector planning model for over 500 of the largest U.S. hydropower facilities. We find that, due to generally increasing river runoff under higher emissions scenarios in the Pacific Northwest, climate change tends to increase overall hydropower generation in the contiguous U.S. During low flow months, generation tends to fall with increasing emissions, potentially threatening the estimated low flow, firm energy from hydropower. Although global GHG mitigation slows the growth in hydropower generation, the higher value placed on carbon-free hydropower leads to annual economic benefits ranging from $1.8 billion to $4.3 billion. The present value of these benefits to the U.S. from global greenhouse gas mitigation, discounted at 3%, is $34 to $45 billion over the 2015–2050 period.},

abstract = {Hydropower is the primary renewable source of energy that harnesses the power of the naturally flowing water streams and its potential is strongly impacted by the hydrological regime. The objective of the present research is to carry out a hydrological model based study to assess the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation by using the regional climate model (RCM) data available through coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX), and subsequently to analyse the effect of using model ensemble in projecting the future hydrology and energy generation scenario. C.H.Corn hydroelectric project located on River Ochlockonee near Tallahassee in Florida, USA, has been considered as a case study. A hydrologic model of the basin, draining into the dam, is developed using a conceptual model HYMOD with the historical climate and flow data extracted from the model parameter estimation experiment (MOPEX) dataset. The future projected climate scenario (2091–2100) is generated following the Representative Concentrated Pathways (RCP) 4.5 with the ensembles of six climate models. The impact of the future climate on water availability indicates a significant seasonal variability among the model ensemble results with an overall annual increase of statistics for the climate variables, corresponding inflows and a marginal increase in the energy generation.},
